AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the second leading cause of death in patients with  cancer. These patients are at a high risk of VTE recurrence and bleeding during  anticoagulant therapy. The International Initiative on Thrombosis and Cancer is an  independent academic working group aimed at establishing a global consensus for the  treatment and prophylaxis of VTE in patients with cancer. The International  Initiative on Thrombosis and Cancer last updated its evidence-based clinical  practice guidelines in 2016 with a free, web-based mobile phone application, which  was subsequently endorsed by the International Society on Thrombosis and  Haemostasis. The 2019 International Initiative on Thrombosis and Cancer clinical  practice guidelines, which are based on a systematic review of the literature  published up to December, 2018, are presented along with a Grading of  Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation scale methods, with the  support of the French National Cancer Institute. These guidelines were reviewed by  an expanded international advisory committee and endorsed by the International  Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Results from head-to-head clinical trials  that compared direct oral anticoagulant with low-molecular-weight heparin are also  summarised, along with new evidence for the treatment and prophylaxis of VTE in  patients with cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Being a healthcare professional can be a uniquely rewarding calling.  However, the demands of training and practice can lead to chronic distress and  serious psychological, interpersonal, and personal health burdens. Although higher  burnout, depression, and suicide rates have been reported in healthcare  professionals, only a minority receive treatment. Concerns regarding  confidentiality, stigma, potential career implications, and cost and time  constraints are cited as key barriers. Web-based and mobile applications have been  shown to mitigate stress, burnout, depression, and suicidal ideation among several  populations and may circumvent these barriers. Here, we reviewed published data on  such resources and selected a small sample that readily can be used by healthcare  providers. METHODS: We searched PubMed for articles evaluating stress, burnout,  depression, and suicide prevention or intervention for healthcare students or  providers and identified five categories of programs with significant effectiveness:  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (online), meditation, mindfulness, breathing, and  relaxation techniques. Using these categories, we searched for Web-based (through  Google and beacon.anu.edu.au -a wellness resource website) and mobile applications  (Apple and mobile. va.gov/appstore ) for stress, burnout, depression, and suicide  prevention and identified 36 resources to further evaluate based on relevance,  applicability to healthcare providers (confidentiality, convenience, and cost), and  the strength of findings supporting their effectiveness. RESULTS: We selected seven  resources under five general categories designed to foster wellness and reduce  burnout, depression, and suicide risk among healthcare workers: breathing  (Breath2Relax), meditation (Headspace, guided meditation audios), Web-based  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MoodGYM, Stress Gym), and suicide prevention apps  (Stay Alive, Virtual Hope Box). CONCLUSIONS: This list serves as a starting point to  enhance coping with stressors as a healthcare student or professional in order to  help mitigate burnout, depression, and suicidality. The next steps include adapting  digital health strategies to specifically fit the needs of healthcare providers,  with the ultimate goal of facilitating in-person care when warranted.

AB  - Background: Weight gain and obesity have reached alarming levels. Eating at a later  clock hour is a newly described risk factor for adverse metabolic health; yet, how  eating at a later circadian time influences body composition is unknown. Using clock  hour to document eating times may be misleading owing to individual differences in  circadian timing relative to clock hour.Objective: This study examined the relations  between the timing of food consumption relative to clock hour and endogenous  circadian time, content of food intake, and body composition.Design: We enrolled 110  participants, aged 18-22 y, in a 30-d cross-sectional study to document sleep and  circadian behaviors within their regular daily routines. We used a  time-stamped-picture mobile phone application to record all food intake across 7  consecutive days during a participant's regular daily routines and assessed their  body composition and timing of melatonin release during an in-laboratory  assessment.Results: Nonlean individuals (high body fat) consumed most of their  calories 1.1 h closer to melatonin onset, which heralds the beginning of the  biological night, than did lean individuals (low body fat) (log-rank P = 0.009). In  contrast, there were no differences between lean and nonlean individuals in the  clock hour of food consumption (P = 0.72). Multiple regression analysis showed that  the timing of food intake relative to melatonin onset was significantly associated  with the percentage of body fat and body mass index (both P < 0.05) while  controlling for sex, whereas no relations were found between the clock hour of food  intake, caloric amount, meal macronutrient composition, activity or exercise level,  or sleep duration and either of these body composition measures (all P >  0.72).Conclusions: These results provide evidence that the consumption of food  during the circadian evening and/or night, independent of more traditional risk  factors such as amount or content of food intake and activity level, plays an  important role in body composition. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov  as NCT02846077.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence for the positive impact of mindfulness on  wellbeing. Mindfulness-based mobile apps may have potential as an alternative  delivery medium for training. While there are hundreds of such apps, there is little  information on their quality. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct a systematic  review of mindfulness-based iPhone mobile apps and to evaluate their quality using a  recently-developed expert rating scale, the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS).  It also aimed to describe features of selected high-quality mindfulness apps.  METHODS: A search for "mindfulness" was conducted in iTunes and Google Apps  Marketplace. Apps that provided mindfulness training and education were included.  Those containing only reminders, timers or guided meditation tracks were excluded.  An expert rater reviewed and rated app quality using the MARS engagement,  functionality, visual aesthetics, information quality and subjective quality  subscales. A second rater provided MARS ratings on 30% of the apps for inter-rater  reliability purposes. RESULTS: The "mindfulness" search identified 700 apps.  However, 94 were duplicates, 6 were not accessible and 40 were not in English. Of  the remaining 560, 23 apps met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. The median MARS  score was 3.2 (out of 5.0), which exceeded the minimum acceptable score (3.0). The  Headspace app had the highest average score (4.0), followed by Smiling Mind (3.7),  iMindfulness (3.5) and Mindfulness Daily (3.5). There was a high level of  inter-rater reliability between the two MARS raters. CONCLUSIONS: Though many apps  claim to be mindfulness-related, most were guided meditation apps, timers, or  reminders. Very few had high ratings on the MARS subscales of visual aesthetics,  engagement, functionality or information quality. Little evidence is available on  the efficacy of the apps in developing mindfulness.

T2  - PloS one
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous evidence suggests that mindfulness training may improve aspects  of psychosocial well-being. Whilst mindfulness is traditionally taught in person,  consumers are increasingly turning to mindfulness-based smartphone apps as an  alternative delivery medium for training. Despite this growing trend, few studies  have explored whether mindfulness delivered via a smartphone app can enhance  psychosocial well-being within the general public. METHODS: The present pilot  randomised controlled trial compared the impact of engaging with the self-guided  mindfulness meditation (MM) app 'Headspace' (n = 38) for a period of 10 or 30 days,  to a wait-list (WL) control (n = 36), using a cohort of adults from the general  population. The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Wagnild  Resilience Scale were administered online at baseline and after 10 and 30 days of  the intervention. RESULTS: Twelve participants (MM n = 9, WL n = 3) were lost to  follow-up for unknown reasons. Relative to the WL control, the MM app positively  impacted self-reported satisfaction with life, stress, and resilience at day 10,  with further improvements emerging at day 30 (Cohen's d = 0.57, 1.42, 0.63  respectively). The rate of improvement was largest at the 10-day assessment point,  dropping moderately by day 30. Participants that rated the MM app as easy to engage  with experienced the largest self-reported benefits. Moreover, the MM app was able  to protect against an unexpected increase in perceived stress that emerged in the  control group. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot randomised controlled trial shows that  self-reported improvements in psychosocial outcomes can be achieved at low cost  through short-term engagement with a mindfulness-based smartphone app, and should be  followed up with more substantive studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of smartphone apps to monitor and deliver health care guidance  and interventions has received considerable attention recently, particularly with  regard to behavioral disorders, stress relief, negative emotional state, and poor  mood in general. Unfortunately, there is little research investigating the long-term  and repeated effects of apps meant to impact mood and emotional state. OBJECTIVE: We  aimed to investigate the effects of both immediate point-of-intervention and  long-term use (ie, at least 10 engagements) of a guided meditation and mindfulness  smartphone app on users' emotional states. Data were collected from users of a  mobile phone app developed by the company Stop, Breathe & Think (SBT) for achieving  emotional wellness. To explore the long-term effects, we assessed changes in the  users' basal emotional state before they completed an activity (eg, a guided  meditation). We also assessed the immediate effects of the app on users' emotional  states from preactivity to postactivity. METHODS: The SBT app collects information  on the emotional state of the user before and after engagement in one or several  mediation and mindfulness activities. These activities are recommended and provided  by the app based on user input. We considered data on over 120,000 users of the app  who collectively engaged in over 5.5 million sessions with the app during an  approximate 2-year period. We focused our analysis on users who had at least 10  engagements with the app over an average of 6 months. We explored the changes in the  emotional well-being of individuals with different emotional states at the time of  their initial engagement with the app using mixed-effects models. In the process, we  compared 2 different methods of classifying emotional states: (1) an expert-defined  a priori mood classification and (2) an empirically driven cluster-based  classification. RESULTS: We found that among long-term users of the app, there was  an association between the length of use and a positive change in basal emotional  state (4% positive mood increase on a 2-point scale every 10 sessions). We also  found that individuals who were anxious or depressed tended to have a favorable  long-term emotional transition (eg, from a sad emotional state to a happier  emotional state) after using the app for an extended period (the odds ratio for  achieving a positive emotional state was 3.2 and 6.2 for anxious and depressed  individuals, respectively, compared with users with fewer sessions). CONCLUSIONS:  Our analyses provide evidence for an association between both immediate and  long-term use of an app providing guided meditations and improvements in the  emotional state.

T2  - Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)
AB  - AIM: Patients with progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) develop positive  phosphate balance that is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and  mortality. Modification of dietary phosphate is a commonly used strategy to improve  outcomes but is complicated by the need for adequate dietary protein. Surprisingly,  the evidence for patient-level benefits from phosphate restriction is tenuous, and  the justification for using any phosphate binder for pre-dialysis patients is  questionable. METHODS: The evidence for dietary phosphate modification was reviewed,  along with the possible role of a smart phone application (app) that provides  information on phosphate, sodium, potassium and nutrients in over 50 000 Australian  foods. A pilot study of healthy participants assigned to dietetic advice and  standard diet sheets, or dietetic advice, diet sheets and use of the smart phone app  was performed. RESULTS: Following baseline studies, 25 participants commenced the  sodium and phosphate restricted diet. After 2 weeks, both groups showed  non-significant trends to reduction in urinary phosphate and sodium. App users  referred to information on the app more frequently than the control group  participants referred to written instructions, found referring to the app more  convenient, felt they learned more new information, were more motivated to maintain  the diet and were more likely to recommend their information source to family or  friends (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining phosphate balance remains an  important goal of CKD management, although diets incorporating very low phosphate  and protein contents may worsen patient outcomes. For selected patients, a smart  phone app may improve dietary acceptance and compliance.

AB  - Mindfulness training, which involves observing thoughts and feelings without  judgment or reaction, has been shown to improve aspects of psychosocial well-being  when delivered via in-person training programs such as mindfulness-based stress  reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Less is known about  the efficacy of digital training mediums, such as smartphone apps, which are rapidly  rising in popularity. In this study, novice meditators were randomly allocated to an  introductory mindfulness meditation program or to a psychoeducational audiobook  control featuring an introduction to the concepts of mindfulness and meditation. The  interventions were delivered via the same mindfulness app, were matched across a  range of criteria, and were presented to participants as well-being programs.  Affect, irritability, and two distinct components of stress were measured  immediately before and after each intervention in a cohort of healthy adults. While  both interventions were effective at reducing stress associated with personal  vulnerability, only the mindfulness intervention had a significant positive impact  on irritability, affect, and stress resulting from external pressure (between group  Cohen's d = 0.44, 0.47, 0.45, respectively). These results suggest that brief  mindfulness training has a beneficial impact on several aspects of psychosocial  well-being, and that smartphone apps are an effective delivery medium for  mindfulness training.

AB  - Smartphone applications for the treatment of depression and anxiety have acquired  millions of users, yet little is known about whether they include evidence-based  therapeutic content. We examined the extent to which popular mental health  applications (MH apps) for depression and anxiety contain treatment elements found  in empirically supported psychotherapy protocols (i.e., "common elements"). Of the  27 MH apps reviewed, 23 included at least one common element, with a median of three  elements. Psychoeducation (in 52% of apps), relaxation (44%), meditation (41%),  mindfulness (37%), and assessment (37%) were the most frequent elements, whereas  several elements (e.g., problem solving) were not found in any apps. We also  identified gaps between app content and empirically supported treatments. Cognitive  restructuring was more common in depression protocols than in depression apps (75%  of protocols vs. 31% of apps), as was problem solving (34% vs. 0%). For anxiety,  exposure (85%, 12%), cognitive restructuring (60%, 12%), and problem solving (25%,  0%) were more common in protocols than apps. Overall, our findings highlight  empirically supported treatment elements that are poorly represented in current MH  apps. The absence of several core treatment elements underscores the need for future  research, including randomized trials testing the effectiveness of popular MH apps.

AB  - PURPOSE: Medical students have higher rates of depression and psychologic distress  than the general population, which may negatively impact academic performance and  professional conduct. This study assessed whether 10-20 min of daily mindfulness  meditation for 30 days, using a mobile phone application, could decrease perceived  stress and improve well-being for medical students. METHODS: Eighty-eight medical  students were stratified by class year and randomized to either intervention or  control groups to use the mobile application Headspace, an audio-guided mindfulness  meditation program, for 30 days. All participants completed the Perceived Stress  Scale (PSS), Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and General Well-Being  Schedule (GWBS) at baseline (T1), 30 days (T2), and 60 days (T3). Repeated measures  analysis of variance (rANOVA) was conducted for intervention versus control groups  across T1, T2, and T3 to examine differences in stress, mindfulness, and well-being.  RESULTS: There was a significant interaction between time and treatment group for  perceived stress and well-being. Perceived stress significantly decreased for the  intervention group from T1 to T3 (F[2,142] = 3.98, p < 0.05). General well-being  significantly increased for the intervention group compared to the control group  from T1 to T2, and the increase was sustained through T3 (F[2,144] = 3.36,  p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight that a mobile audio-guided  mindfulness meditation program is an effective means to decrease perceived stress in  medical students, which may have implications on patient care. Integrating  mindfulness training into medical school curricula for management of school- and  work-related stress may lead to fewer negative physician outcomes (e.g., burnout,  anxiety, and depression) and improved physician and patient outcomes. This has  implications for a broad group of therapists and healthcare providers, ultimately  improving quality of healing and patient care.

AB  - Patients and families increasingly use mobile apps as a relaxation and distraction  intervention for children with complex, chronic medical conditions in the waiting  room setting or during inpatient hospitalizations; and yet, there is limited data on  app quality assessment or review of these apps for level of engagement,  functionality, aesthetics, or applicability for palliative pediatric patients. The  pediatric palliative care study team searched smartphone application platforms for  apps relevant to calming, relaxation, and mindfulness for pediatric and adolescent  patients. Apps were reviewed using a systematic data extraction tool. Validated  Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) scores were determined by two blinded  reviewers. Apps were then characterized by infant, child, adolescent, and adult  caregiver group categories. Reviewer discussion resulted in consensus. Sixteen of  the 22 apps identified were included in the final analysis. The apps operated on  either iOS or Android platforms. All were available in English with four available  in Spanish. Apps featured a relaxation approach (12/16), soothing images (8/16), and  breathing techniques (8/16). Mood and sleep patterns were the main symptoms targeted  by apps. Provision of mobile apps resource summary has the potential to foster  pediatric palliative care providers' knowledge of app functionality and  applicability as part of ongoing patient care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A game-based virtual reality phone application is used as a simulation  to teach psychomotor skills in nursing education. OBJECTIVE: This study aims at  determining the effect of a game-based virtual reality phone application on  tracheostomy care education for nursing students. DESIGN: Single-blind randomized  controlled trial conducted from March-April 2017. SETTING: Department of Nursing,  Faculty of Health Sciences, Central Anatolia of Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 86  first-year nursing students registered in Fundamentals of Nursing-II were included  in this study. The students were divided at random into two groups, control (n = 43)  and experimental (n = 43). METHOD: The data were collected with an informative  features form, a tracheostomy care knowledge test and skill checklists, and a  performance assessment form. The control group commenced the study first so that the  students did not affect each other. After the students completed the theoretical  class, laboratory class, and small group study, they had their knowledge test and  skills evaluation. The application featured tracheostomy care and was designed in  support of formal education. It was uploaded to the mobile phones of the  experimental group at a different phase of the study from the control group. After  the experimental group made use of this application for seven days, their last  knowledge test and skills evaluation were conducted. RESULTS: The results of this  study determined that the suctioning a tracheostomy tube and peristomal skin care  average final test scores of the students in the experiment group were higher than  the average scores of the students in the control group; this was statistically  significant (p = 0.017, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The game-based virtual reality phone  application was effective in teaching the skill of suctioning a tracheostomy tube  for nursing students in the short term, and it is recommended that this application  be used in psychomotor skill training.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Physical exercise is recommended for individuals with type 1 diabetes,  yet the effects of exercise on glycemic control are not well established. We  evaluated the impact of different modes of exercise on glycemic control in people  with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: In a 3-week randomized crossover trial, 10 adults  with type 1 diabetes (4 men and 6 women, aged 33±6 years; duration of diabetes,  18±10 years; glycated hemoglobin level, 7.4%±1%) were assigned to 3 weeks of  intervention: aerobic exercise (treadmill at 60% of maximum volume of oxygen  utilization), resistance training (8 to 12 repetitions of 5 upper and lower body  exercises at 60% to 80% of 1 repetition maximum) or no exercise (control). During  each exercise week, participants completed 2 monitored 45 min exercise sessions. For  each week of the study, we analyzed participants' insulin pump data, sensor glucose  data and meal intake using a custom smart-phone application. The primary outcome was  the percentage of time in range (glucose >3.9 mmol/L and ≤10 mmol/L) for the 24 h  after each bout of exercise or rest during the control week. The study was  registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT:02687893). RESULTS: Aerobic exercise caused a  mean glucose reduction during exercise of 3.94±2.67 mmol/L, whereas the reduction  during resistance training was 1.33±1.78 mmol/L (p=0.007). The mean percentage time  in range for the 24 h after resistance training was significantly greater than that  during the control period (70% vs. 56%, p=0.013) but not after aerobic exercise  (60%). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that when various confounders are  considered, resistance training could improve glycemic control in this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness meditation has become increasingly popular over the last few  years, due in part to the increase in mobile apps incorporating the practice.  Although studies have demonstrated the potential of mindfulness meditation to  positively impact health, little has been uncovered about what predicts engagement  in mindfulness meditation. Understanding the predictors of mindfulness meditation  may help practitioners and phone app developers improve intervention strategies and  app experience. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to use the Theory of  Planned Behavior and Temporal Self-Regulation Theory to determine factors predicting  mindfulness meditation mobile app use. METHODS: The sample consisted of 85  undergraduate students with no prior mindfulness meditation experience. During their  first laboratory visit, participants completed tasks to measure their executive  functioning and a survey to measure Theory of Planned Behavior constructs about  mindfulness meditation. Over the following 2 weeks, participants logged the days and  minutes that they practiced mindfulness meditation using a phone app. Hierarchical  regression modeling was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: After controlling for  demographic factors, participant subjective norms (beta=14.51, P=.001) and  intentions (beta=36.12, P=.001) were predictive of the number of minutes practicing  mindfulness. Participant executive functioning did not predict mindfulness  meditation practice, nor did it moderate the link between intentions and mindfulness  meditation practice. Participant attitudes (beta=0.44, P<.001) and perceived control  (beta=0.42, P=.002) were positively associated with intentions to practice  mindfulness. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that among college student  populations, the Theory of Planned Behavior may be useful in predicting the use of  mindfulness meditation phone apps. However, participant executive functioning was  not a predictor or moderator of mindfulness practice, and Temporal Self-Regulation  Theory may be less useful for explaining mindfulness meditation behaviors using  phone apps over a short period of time among college students. The results have  implications for public health professionals, suggesting that a focus on subjective  norms and intentions may promote mindfulness meditation practice using phone apps.

AB  - Commercial sleep devices and mobile-phone applications for scoring sleep are gaining  ground. In order to provide reliable information about the quantity and/or quality  of sleep, their performance needs to be assessed against the current gold standard,  i.e., polysomnography (PSG; measuring brain, eye, and muscle activity). Here, we  assessed some commercially available sleep trackers, namely an activity tracker; Mi  band (Xiaomi, Beijing, China), a scientific actigraph: Motionwatch 8 (CamNTech,  Cambridge, UK), and a much-used mobile phone application: Sleep Cycle (Northcube,  Gothenburg, Sweden). We recorded 27 nights in healthy sleepers using PSG and these  devices and compared the results. Surprisingly, all devices had poor agreement with  the PSG gold standard. Sleep parameter comparisons revealed that, specifically, the  Mi band and the Sleep Cycle application had difficulties in detecting wake periods  which negatively affected their total sleep time and sleep-efficiency estimations.  However, all 3 devices were good in detecting the most basic parameter, the actual  time in bed. In summary, our results suggest that, to date, the available sleep  trackers do not provide meaningful sleep analysis but may be interesting for simply  tracking time in bed. A much closer interaction with the scientific field seems  necessary if reliable information shall be derived from such devices in the future.

AB  - Athletes often have significant gaps in their nutrition knowledge. Thus, the aim of  this study was to investigate whether young Finnish endurance athletes' nutrition  knowledge and dietary intake can be improved through an education intervention with  or without a mobile food application. Seventy-nine endurance athletes, 18.0 years  (SD: 1.4), participated in this randomized, controlled intervention. We compared the  effects of participatory nutrition education sessions alone (group EDU) to those  including the use of a mobile food application (group EDU + APP) for four days after  each session. Both groups attended three 90-min education sessions fortnightly. The  participants completed a validated nutrition knowledge questionnaire in Weeks 0, 5,  and 17, and a three-day food diary in Weeks 0 and 17. The education plan was based  on the Self-Determination Theory and the concept of meaningful learning process. The  EDU group's nutrition knowledge scores were: 78 (week 0), 85 (week 5), and 84 (week  17) and the EDU + APP group's 78, 86, and 85, respectively. Nutrition knowledge  increased significantly (main effect of time (p < 0.001)), but we observed no  significant group × time interaction (p = 0.309). The changes in dietary intakes  were minor (p > 0.05). The amount of carbohydrates was below endurance athletes'  recommendations throughout the intervention. The reported energy intakes were also  below the estimated energy expenditures. In conclusion, nutrition knowledge improved  significantly after only three education sessions and food diary feedback, but the  mobile app did not improve learning further. However, the nutrition education  intervention alone was not enough to change dietary intake.

AB  - Because of the growing size and aging of the world's population, the global burden  of stroke is increasing dramatically. Current epidemiological data indicate that  16.9 million people suffer a stroke each year, which represents a global incidence  of 258/100,000/year, with marked differences between high- and low-income countries,  and an age-adjusted incidence 1.5 times higher in men than in women. Although  primary prevention has contributed to a decrease in stroke incidence in high-income  countries, the so-called 'epidemiological transition' has led to an increase in  incidence in middle-to-low-income countries as well. In addition, the incidence of  ischemic stroke in young adults is on the rise, suggesting a need for specific  preventative interventions in that age group. The number of stroke survivors almost  doubled between 1990 and 2010, and has now reached 33 million people. According to  epidemiological projections, this number will rise to 77 million by 2030. In France,  the number of hospitalizations for an acute cerebrovascular event was about 138,000  in 2009, accounting for 3% of the total national health expenditure. Outcomes after  stroke are frequently impaired by complications, including motor handicaps,  dementia, depression, fatigue, and a high risk of early rehospitalization and  institutionalization, with adverse consequences in terms of socioeconomic costs. In  addition, there are 5.9 million stroke-related deaths worldwide every year. Finally,  although many analytical epidemiological studies have considerably increased our  knowledge of risk factors for stroke, the recent INTERSTROKE study provided evidence  that 10 risk factors alone accounted for 88% of all strokes. Many of these risk  factors are modifiable, which suggests that efforts should be made to promote  interventions that aim to reduce the risk of stroke. A new 'mass approach' aiming to  reduce the level of stroke risk factors in all people in a region, regardless of any  given individual's level of risk, is currently still being developed. This  interesting and innovative way to spread stroke awareness is based on the use of an  internationally validated mobile-phone application that can calculate the risk of  stroke for any given individual, and also contains a section to educate people on  stroke warning symptoms and signs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: University students are at risk of weight gain during their studies. Key  factors related to weight gain in this population include unhealthy weight-related  behaviors because of stress. Mindfulness holds promise for weight management.  However, there has not been any previous trial that has explored the effectiveness  of a student-tailored mindfulness app for stress, weight-related behaviors, and  weight. There is limited evidence that current mindfulness apps use evidence-based  mindfulness techniques. A novel app was developed that combined evidence-based,  mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindful eating (ME) techniques that were  tailored to university students, with student-relevant themes for targeting weight  behaviors, weight, and stress. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the  effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of a student-tailored mindfulness app  for weight, weight-related behaviors, and stress. Testing this app in a rigorous  randomized controlled trial (RCT) for these outcomes is a novelty and contribution  to this emerging field. METHODS: A 2-arm RCT of an 11-week duration was undertaken  at the University of Queensland. Students were either randomized to the mindfulness  app (n=45) or to a behavioral self-monitoring electronic diary (e-diary; n=45) for  diet and exercise. Analysis of covariance was used to compare differences in weight,  stress, mindfulness, ME, physical activity, and eating behaviors between both  groups. RESULTS: Neither the mindfulness app group nor the e-diary group lost weight  and there were no differences between the groups at follow-up. The mindfulness app  group had significantly lower stress levels (P=.02) (adherers only), lower emotional  eating (P=.02), and uncontrolled eating (P=.02) as well as higher mindfulness  (P≤.001) and ME levels overall (P≤.001). The e-diary group had higher metabolic  equivalents of moderate activity levels (P≤.01). However, the effect sizes were  small. Regular adherence to mindfulness exercises in the app was low in the group.  The majority of students (94%) liked the app and found it to be acceptable. Compared  with other exercises, the most helpful reported meditation was the short breathing  exercise observing the breath (39.4% [13/33] preferred it). This was the first RCT  that tested a mindfulness app for weight and weight-related behaviors in students.  The modest level of user adherence likely contributes to the lack of effect on  weight loss. However, there was a small, albeit promising, effect on weight-related  eating behavior and stress. CONCLUSIONS: A mindfulness app demonstrated  effectiveness for stress, eating behaviors, mindfulness, and ME, but the effect  sizes were small. Future studies should be conducted over longer periods of time and  with greater participant compliance.

AB  - Along with the creativity of vast technological advances, humanity's endemic  destructiveness continues. Planetary healing needs motivated this research. The aim  was an empirical and heuristic phenomenological investigation into and an evaluation  of the theoretical and technological implications of the HeartMath Global Coherence  Initiative. The single case study, and limited amount of data, indicated the null  hypothesis. Methodology included HeartMath Inner Balance tool and newly developed  Global Coherence application (app). Data collection involved linked empirical  measures and experiential journaling. Quantitative data analysis, which consisted of  statistical analysis of correlations between six existing Global Coherence  magnetometers and empirical measures of meditation records, from Inner Balance and  Global coherence apps, respectively, yielded unexpected findings, both significant  and insignificant, in the form of trends towards global and local group coherence,  respectively. Qualitative findings essentially revealed variations on the,  interrelated, consciousness themes of wholeness, holistic healing, energy healing  and meditation. In addition to various limitations and implications, interpretation  of integrative findings indicated theoretical and practical support for the  HeartMath mission and vision of developing and promoting personal, social and global  coherence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians often use thirty-second-sit (chair)-to-stand (30CST),  timed-up-and-go (TUG), and the five-times-sit-to-stand (5xSTS) since these outcome  measures (OMs) are sensitive for strength, balance and mobility. RESEARCH QUESTION:  The purpose of this study was to validate a custom smart phone application (App)  that can remotely assess the 30CST, TUG, and 5xSTS. METHODS: Thirty-one healthy  adults (range: 22-55 y; 54.6-106.8 kg; 160-185 cm; 19 females) participated in this  cross-sectional study. Each participant performed the 30CST, TUG, and 5xSTS at a  slow and normal speed. They performed each OMs twice while the App collected their  performance data using both an iOS and Android phone. The gold standard of each test  was the average of the silent count of two investigators for the 30CST and the time  recorded by two investigators using stopwatches for the TUG and 5xSTS. Investigators  analyzed the data using Intraclass Correlation coefficients (ICC), Pearson R  coefficients, Signed Rank Tests, and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Tests. RESULTS AND  SIGNIFICANCE: A significant correlation was observed between the performances  recorded by the phones and the direct observation gold standard for all three OMs  (r > 0.97). For 30CST, no significant mean count differences were found for the  following comparisons: between phones, within phone types, or within phone-by-speed  levels. (P-values range 0.06-1.00). While a statistically significant difference was  found in all of the time comparisons when performing TUG and 5xSTS (p < 0.0001)  except for the between phone comparison with TUG (p = 0.27). For TUG and 5xSTS, the  time difference was less than a second when compared to the gold standard and ICCs  showed moderate to strong agreement when comparing the phone application to the gold  standard (ICCs range 0.60-0.99). These data suggested that the App could validly  measure performance of these OMs.

TI  - Developing a phone-based measure of impairment after acute oral  ∆(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol.
AU  - Pabon, Elisa

T2  - Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute consumption of cannabis or its primary psychoactive ingredient  ∆(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol has been shown to impair memory, reaction time, time  perception, and attention. However, it is difficult to measure these impairments in  a brief test that can be used in a non-laboratory setting. AIMS: We aim to develop  and validate a prototype for a mobile phone application to measure  ∆(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced cognitive impairment. METHODS: We conducted two  double-blind, within-subjects studies examining impairments after oral doses of  ∆(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (0, 7.5, 15 mg) using both standardized computer-based  tasks and our novel phone-based tasks. The tasks measured cognitive speed, reaction  time, fine motor ability, and working memory and, in the second study, time  perception. Study 1 (n=24) provided initial data, and Study 2 (n=24) was designed to  refine the measures. In both studies, healthy non-daily cannabis users participated  in three four-hour experimental sessions in which they received capsules containing  ∆(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (7.5, 15 mg) or placebo. Subjective and cardiovascular  measures were obtained at regular intervals, and at the time of peak drug effect  subjects completed both standardized, computer-based and brief, phone-based tasks.  RESULTS: ∆(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol-induced impairment was detected on most of the  computer tasks, but was not evident on most of the phone tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The  phone tasks were brief, to facilitate use in a non-laboratory setting, but it is  likely that this made them less sensitive to the impairing effects of  ∆(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol. These findings confirm that ∆(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol  impairs performance on several tasks at two recreationally relevant doses, but  raises question about the feasibility of designing a phone application as a  sensitive field sobriety test for cannabis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms can be triggered by food intake and  psychological distress, but individual-level research on food-symptom and  stress-symptom associations is scarce. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify associations  between food intake, psychological distress and gastrointestinal symptoms, and their  implications for personalised clinical management. METHODS: Through the mobile phone  application mySymptoms, 163 users kept, for a median of five weeks, a diary of food  intake, psychological distress and gastrointestinal symptoms. We quantified  associations between these on the individual level. The presence of individual-level  associations was compared over latent classes of daily symptom patterns. RESULTS:  Various gastrointestinal symptoms had demonstrable food-symptom associations  (heartburn: 73%, discomfort: 67%, diarrhoea: 57%, bloating: 53%, and gas: 48%).  Food-symptom associations for pain in the abdomen (33%) were concentrated in the  latent class of individuals with pain in the morning (68%), rather than those with  pain in the evening and night (27% and 10%, respectively, p < 0.001). Stress-symptom  relations were also found, although only 18% of individuals reported psychological  distress. CONCLUSION: Personal food-symptom and stress-symptom relations can be  detected, and may translate into specific daily symptom patterns. A next step will  be to let personal food-symptom and stress-symptom relations serve as the basis for  personalised clinical management.

AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of on-demand use of anakinra in patients with crFMF. The  Gazi FMF cohort was established in the year 2010, and from that date, 689 patients  with FMF diagnosed according to the Tel Hashomer criteria were registered. Attack  type, duration, severity, and their impact on life were collected either by disease  diaries or a mobile phone application (FMF AIDD, AppStore, and Playstore). A  retrospective cohort analysis was made from records of patients who have ever been  treated with IL-1 inhibitors. A total of 78 patients were treated with IL-1  inhibitors in our cohort. Among these, 15 patients were identified who received  on-demand anakinra. Rationale for on-demand use was prominent prodrome or trigger  for attacks and patient's personal claim. Six patients were switched from regular  use and nine were directly started as on-demand use. All were using background  colchicine in maximum tolerated doses. None of the patients had evidence of  persistently elevated acute phase reactants or proteinuria. The median duration of  on-demand anakinra use was 6 (3-36) months. Pre- and post- on-demand anakinra  periods were compared. Patient reported attack severity (p = 0.002), duration  (p = 0.001), frequency (p = 0.001), absenteeism (p = 0.002), and presenteeism  (p = 0.002) were significantly improved. On-demand anakinra prevented progression of  prodromes to full-blown attacks which was demonstrated by decrease in the rate of  attack/prodrome ratio (p = 0.02). On-demand anakinra can be continued in ten  subjects on long-term. On-demand anakinra significantly improved FMF attacks in  certain patients which suggest this approach would be of benefit in daily practice  in selected patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients suffer from long-term  symptoms and reduced quality of life. Mindfulness meditation is a complementary  therapy shown to be beneficial for alleviating a range of cancer-related symptoms;  however, in-person meditation interventions are difficult for cancer patients to  attend. Meditation via a mobile phone app represents a novel approach in MPN  patients for delivering meditation. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to report MPN  patients' (ie, naïve or nearly naïve meditators) perceptions of meditation and  explore their experiences in the context of using a mobile phone for meditation  after participation in an 8-week consumer-based meditation app feasibility study.  METHODS: MPN patients (n=128) were recruited nationally through organizational  partners and social media. Eligible and consented patients were enrolled into 1 of 4  groups, 2 that received varying orders of 2 consumer-based apps (10% Happier and  Calm) and 2 that received one of the apps alone for the second 4 weeks of the 8-week  intervention after an educational control condition. Participants were asked to  perform 10 min per day of mobile phone-based meditation, irrespective of the app and  order in which they received the apps. At the conclusion of the study, participants  were asked whether they would like to participate in a 20-min phone interview  comprising 9 to 10 questions to discuss their perceptions and experiences while  using the mobile phone meditation apps. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and  imported into NVivo 12 (QSR International) for coding and analysis, using a  combination of deductive and inductive methods to organize the data, generate  categories, and develop themes and subthemes. RESULTS: A total of 48 MPN patients  completed postintervention interviews, of which 29% (14/48) of the patients only  used the 10% Happier app, 21% (10/48) of the patients only used the Calm app, and  46% (22/48) of the patients used both apps during the 8-week intervention. Themes  identified in the analysis of interview data related to (1) perceptions of  meditation before, during, and after the study, (2) perceptions of the Calm app, (3)  perceptions of the 10% Happier app, (4) perceived impacts of using the meditation  apps, (5) overall experiences of participating in the study, (6) recommendations  surrounding meditation for other MPN patients, and (7) plans to continue meditation.  CONCLUSIONS: The qualitative findings of this study suggest that MPN patients who  are naïve or nearly naïve meditators perceived mobile phone meditation as enjoyable,  preferred the Calm app over the 10% Happier app, perceived the Calm app as more  appealing (eg, narrator's voice and different meditations or background sounds  offered), and perceived beneficial effects of meditation on mental health, sleep,  fatigue, and pain. Future research is needed to better understand the efficacy of  mobile phone meditation on MPN patient outcomes and meditation app design features  that enhance uptake among its users.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nowadays, Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT) is a first line, level 1  evidence-based treatment for urinary incontinence (UI), but adherence to PFMT is  often problematic. Today, there are several mobile applications (mApps) for PFMT,  but many lack specific strategies for enhancing adherence. AIMS: To review available  mApps for improvement of adherence to PFMT, and to introduce a new App so called  iPelvis. METHODS: Review study all available mApps for PFMT and relevant literature  regarding adherence by electronic search through the databases Pubmed, Embase,  CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, and Scielo. Based on these results, development of a mApp,  called "iPelvis" for Apple™ and Android™ systems, implementing relevant strategies  to improve adherence. RESULTS: Based on the current adherence literature we were  able to identify 12 variables helping to create the optimal mApp for PFMT. None of  the identified 61 mApps found for Android™ and 16 for Apple™ has all these 12  variables. iPelvis mApp and websites were constructed taking into consideration  those 12 variables and its construct is now being subject to ongoing validation  studies. CONCLUSION: MApps for PFMT are an essential part of first-line, efficient  interventions of UI and have potentials to improve adherence, in case these respect  the principles of PFMT, motor learning and adherence to PFMT. iPelvis has been  constructed respecting all essential variables related to adherence to PFMT and may  enhance the effects of UI treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several cost-effective programs are being implemented around the world  that use mobile technology to improve Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) uptake  and awareness among youth. Mobile phone applications are a viable and effective  means of increasing access to SRH services and tools in low and middle-income  countries. This paper presents a protocol for a pilot study of a novel program, a  mobile phone-based sexual and reproductive health services awareness and delivery  application with the objective of increasing the demand for SRH services amongst the  youth in Uganda. METHODS: The study employs rigorous evaluation methods to ascertain  the impact of the mobile application. We propose a randomized control trial study to  determine the causal effect of the mobile phone app in creating awareness and  increasing uptake of sexual and reproductive health services in Uganda. The main  outcome of the impact evaluation is the percentage change in the SRH services and  tools uptake, SRH knowledge and sexual behavior. We will also conduct a model-based  incremental cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and budget impact analysis (BIA). The  main outcomes of the economic evaluation will be the average cost per app user, cost  per app service and tool provided. We will also test the in-app advertising model as  a way to generate revenue to sustain the program subsidies and related costs.  DISCUSSION: The study seeks to establish the proof of concept of using a mobile  application to increase create awareness and increase uptake of SRH tools and  services among youth in Uganda. The study results will lead to the development of a  demand-driven, culturally-relevant, and easy-to-use mobile app to enhance the uptake  of SRH services among the youth in Uganda and globally.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuing education aims at assisting physicians to maintain competency  and expose them to emerging issues in their field. Over the last decade, approaches  to the delivery of educational content have changed dramatically as medical  education at all levels is now benefitting from the use of web-based content and  applications for mobile devices. The aim of the present study is to investigate  through a randomized trial the effectiveness of a smart phone application to  increase public health service physicians' (PHS physicians) knowledge regarding  pediatric oral health care. METHOD: Five of all seven DHCs (District Health Center)  in Tehran, which were under the supervision of Tehran University of Medical Sciences  and Iran University of Medical Sciences, were selected for our study. Physicians of  one DHC had participated in a pilot study. All PHS physicians in the other four  centers were invited to the current study on a voluntary basis (n = 107). They  completed a self-administered questionnaire regarding their knowledge, attitudes,  practice in pediatric dentistry, and background. PHS physicians were assigned  randomly to intervention and control groups; those in the intervention group,  received a newly designed evidence-based smartphone application, and those in the  control group received a booklet, a CME seminar, and a pamphlet. A post-intervention  survey was administered 4 months later and t-test and repeated measures ANCOVA  (Analysis of Covariance) were performed to measure the difference in the PHS  physicians' knowledge, attitude and practice. RESULTS: In both groups, the mean  knowledge scores were significantly higher (p-Value < 0.001) in post-intervention  data compared to those at baseline. Similar results existed in attitude and practice  scores. Although the scores in knowledge in the intervention group indicating  potentially greater improvement when compared to those of the control group, the  differences between the two groups were not statistically significant (dif: 0.84,  95% CI - 0.35 to 2.02). CONCLUSION: In the light of the limitations of the present  study, smart phone applications could improve knowledge, attitude and practice in  physicians although this method was not superior to the conventional method of CME.  TRIAL REGISTRATION: Our clinical trial had been registered in Iranian Registry of  Clinical Trials (registration code: IRCT2016091029765N1).

AB  - AIMS/INTRODUCTION: There is potential for mobile applications to deliver new  self-management interventions for chronic disease, especially in diabetes. The aim  of the present study was to evaluate the effects of a mobile phone application (MPA)  combined with or without self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) on glycemic control  in patients with diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a 24-week period,  four-arm parallel group, non-blinded, randomized trial. A total of 185 patients with  mean age of 52 years were randomized to group A (no MPA and no SMBG), group B (SMBG  only), group C (MPA only) and group D (both MPA and SMBG were used). Changes in  glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose and 1,5-anhydroglucitol from  baseline to week 24 were analyzed. RESULTS: At 24 weeks, the HbA1c levels in  patients of all groups decreased significantly from baseline. There were significant  differences in the proportions of patients that achieved HbA1c <7% between groups,  especially in group C and group D, compared with group A at week 24 (60.4%, 62.2% vs  25.5%, all P < 0.05). 1,5-Anhydroglucitol changes were obvious in group A and  group C at week 24 from baseline (all P < 0.05 within groups). Factorial analysis of  anova showed that MPA intervention was the main effective factor for HbA1c change  (F = 4.59, P = 0.034), and there was no effect on HbA1c change for SMBG intervention  (P = 0.975). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the MPA, Diabetes-Carer, is effective in  improving the proportion of HbA1c <7% in patients with type 2 diabetes.

AU  - Peterson, Seth
T2  - Physiotherapy theory and practice
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improvements in chronic low back pain (CLBP) seen in physical therapy do  not appear to be retained over the long term. Booster sessions have been proposed,  but barriers exist to their implementation. Telerehabilitation (TR) and remote  patient monitoring (RPM) may be ways to circumvent these barriers. The purpose of  this case series was to describe the implementation of TR booster sessions and RPM  in three patients with CLBP. CASE SERIES: Three females with CLBP tracked their  daily pain level and home exercise program adherence using a mobile phone  application for 12 months following discharge from traditional face-to-face physical  therapy. Synchronous audio and video TR booster sessions were conducted at months 1,  3, 6, and 12. OUTCOMES: All patients met their individual goals. They demonstrated  excellent home exercise program adherence and self-efficacy. A temporary increase in  pain was seen in all patients, but they managed solely with the TR booster sessions  and without other healthcare resources. Satisfaction with the program was very high.  CONCLUSIONS: This case series describes the use of TR booster sessions and RPM in  three patients with CLBP. The positive results suggest this approach may be helpful  in improving long-term management of patients with CLBP but demand further  investigation.

AU  - Bond, Diana M.
AU  - Morris, Jonathan M.

T2  - BMC pregnancy and childbirth
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mastitis and accompanying pain have been associated with the cessation  of breastfeeding. Mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the breast and may be a  result of decreased immunity and a lowered resistance to infection. Mastitis affects  up to one in five breastfeeding women with most episodes occurring in the first 6-8  weeks postpartum. Antibiotics are often used in the treatment of mastitis, but have  not been popular or proven effective as a preventative agent. The WHO has  highlighted significant concerns relating to adverse harms of antibiotic use with  the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of disease organisms. Increasing  research suggests that specific probiotic bacteria possess significant  anti-inflammatory properties and supports their potential use as immunomodulatory  agents. While animal studies have shown promising results in the use of probiotics  for preventing mastitis, their use in human trials has had limited investigation.  The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral probiotics for the  prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women. METHODS: APProve (CAn Probiotics  ImProve Breastfeeding Outcomes?) is a double-blind randomised controlled trial  designed to assess outcomes between breastfeeding women ingesting a probiotic versus  a placebo daily for 8 weeks following birth. A total of 600 women (300 to each arm)  who intend to breastfeed will be randomised after the birth of a term, healthy  infant. Daily and weekly surveys for 8 weeks and follow-up surveys at 2, 6 and  12 months after birth will assess the primary outcome of mastitis in the first  8 weeks following birth as well as secondary maternal outcomes of breastfeeding  duration (total/partial), antibiotic use, maternal health and well-being, and  treatment compliance; and infant outcomes including gastroenteritis, infant health  and well-being and growth and development. The acceptability and compliance using a  novel mobile phone application system will also be evaluated. DISCUSSION: There is  an urgent need to explore safe and effective alternatives for preventing mastitis in  breastfeeding women. This trial seeks to provide evidence for such an alternative in  the form of probiotics, which may also increase breastfeeding duration, providing  long-term health, cognitive and developmental benefits for children. Decreased  antibiotic usage also benefits the community and health system. TRIAL REGISTRATION:  Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12615000923561 .

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to treatment is associated with poor asthma control,  increased exacerbations, decline in lung function, and decreased quality of life.  M-health applications have become increasingly in the last years, but little  research regarding the efficiency of the instructional videos for correct inhaler  use exist. The aim of this study is to assess and improve the inhalator technique  and to establish which types of errors were made more often with the help of a  mobile health application. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five patients with  partially controlled or uncontrolled asthma, using any of turbuhaler, diskus,  pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) or soft mist inhaler (SMI), were included in  the study. When they first entered the study, the patient's inhaler technique was  assessed by a trained medical professional and the technique errors were categorized  in handling, respectively inhalation errors. After the first evaluation, the  patients downloaded an application on their Smartphone and were encouraged to use  the application as much as needed to remind them the correct inhalation technique.  The patients were re-called every three months for evaluation, treatment, and  assessment of inhalation technique. RESULTS: We analyzed both handling and  inhalation errors for each of the four considered inhalers. We observed a  significantly reduced number of inhalation technique errors after using the mobile  phone application. Turbuhaler median errors were 6.00, and after six months we did  not observe errors. Diskus median error was 6.00, and after six months we observed a  maximum of one error. pMDI median errors were 7.00, and after six months we observed  just one error. Similarly, SMI median error was 7.00, and after six months we  observed just one error. CONCLUSION: Although technique inhalation errors are very  common among asthma patients, video instructions provided through specific mobile  phone applications could improve the inhaler technique in order to achieve a better  control of the disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness training (MT) includes a variety of contemplative practices  aimed at promoting intentional awareness of experience, coupled with attitudes of  nonjudgment and curiosity. Following the success of 8-week, manualized group  interventions, MT has been implemented in a variety of modalities, including  smartphone apps that seek to replicate the success of group interventions. However,  although smartphone apps are scalable and accessible to a wider swath of population,  their benefits remain largely untested. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate a  newly developed MT app called Wildflowers, which was codeveloped with the laboratory  for use in mindfulness research. It was hypothesized that 3 weeks of MT through this  app would improve subjective well-being, attentional control, and interoceptive  integration, albeit with weaker effects than those published in the 8 week,  manualized group intervention literature. METHODS: Undergraduate students completed  3 weeks of MT with Wildflowers (n=45) or 3 weeks of cognitive training with a game  called 2048 (n=41). State training effects were assessed through pre- and  postsession ratings of current mood, stress level, and heart rate. Trait training  effects were assessed through pre- and postintervention questionnaires canvassing  subjective well-being and behavioral task measures of attentional control and  interoceptive integration. State and trait training data were analyzed in a  multilevel model using emergent latent factors (acceptance, awareness, and openness)  to summarize the trait questionnaire battery. RESULTS: Analyses revealed both state  and trait effects specific to MT; participants engaging in MT demonstrated improved  mood (r=.14) and a reduction of stress (r=-.13) immediately after each training  session compared with before the training session and decreased postsession stress  over 3 weeks (r=-.08). In addition, MT relative to cognitive training resulted in  greater improvements in attentional control (r=-.24). Interestingly, both groups  demonstrated increased subjective ratings of awareness (r=.28) and acceptance  (r=.23) from pre- to postintervention, with greater changes in acceptance for the MT  group trending (r=.21). CONCLUSIONS: MT, using a smartphone app, may provide  immediate effects on mood and stress while also providing long-term benefits for  attentional control. Although further investigation is warranted, there is evidence  that with continued usage, MT via a smartphone app may provide long-term benefits in  changing how one relates to their inner and outer experiences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The vertical jump is used to estimate sports performance capabilities  and physical fitness in children, elderly, non-athletic and injured individuals.  Different jump techniques and measurement tools are available to assess vertical  jump height and peak power; however, their use is limited by access to laboratory  settings, excessive cost and/or time constraints thus making these tools oftentimes  unsuitable for field assessment. A popular field test uses the Vertec and the  Sargent vertical jump with countermovement; however, new low cost, easy to use tools  are becoming available, including the My Jump iOS mobile application (app). The  purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of the My Jump relative to  values obtained by the Vertec for the Sargent stand and reach vertical jump (VJ)  test. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-five healthy participants aged 18-39 years (94  males, 41 females) completed three maximal Sargent VJ with countermovement that were  simultaneously measured using the Vertec and the My Jump. Jump heights were  quantified for each jump and peak power was calculated using the Sayers equation.  Four separate ICC estimates and their 95% confidence intervals were used to assess  reliability. Two analyses (with jump height and calculated peak power as the  dependent variables, respectively) were based on a single rater, consistency,  two-way mixed-effects model, while two others (with jump height and calculated peak  power as the dependent variables, respectively) were based on a single rater,  absolute agreement, two-way mixed-effects model. RESULTS: Moderate to excellent  reliability relative to the degree of consistency between the Vertec and My Jump  values was found for jump height (ICC = 0.813; 95% CI [0.747-0.863]) and calculated  peak power (ICC = 0.926; 95% CI [0.897-0.947]). However, poor to good reliability  relative to absolute agreement for VJ height (ICC = 0.665; 95% CI [0.050-0.859]) and  poor to excellent reliability relative to absolute agreement for peak power (ICC =  0.851; 95% CI [0.272-0.946]) between the Vertec and My Jump values were found;  Vertec VJ height, and thus, Vertec calculated peak power values, were significantly  higher than those calculated from My Jump values (p < 0.0001). DISCUSSION: The My  Jump app may provide a reliable measure of vertical jump height and calculated peak  power in multiple field and laboratory settings without the need of costly equipment  such as force plates or Vertec. The reliability relative to degree of consistency  between the Vertec and My Jump app was moderate to excellent. However, the  reliability relative to absolute agreement between Vertec and My Jump values  contained significant variation (based on CI values), thus, it is recommended that  either the My Jump or the Vertec be used to assess VJ height in repeated measures  within subjects' designs; these measurement tools should not be considered  interchangeable within subjects or in group measurement designs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As a prevalent metabolic disease, diabetes has different side effects  and causes a wide range of co morbidity with a high rate of mortality. There is a  need for certain interventions to manage this disease. Iranians usually have three  main meals a day. Considering the special needs of diabetic patients and the  possibility of hypoglycemia between the main meals, it is essential for these  patients to eat something as a snack. Considering these conditions and the society's  orientation towards modern technologies such as smart phones, designing mobile-based  nutrition recommender systems can be helpful. METHODS: The snack recommender system  is a knowledge-based smart phone application. This study has focused on the  development of a recommender system that combines artificial intelligence techniques  and makes up a knowledge base according to the guidelines posed by the American  Diabetes Association (ADA). The snack menu was recommended in accordance with the  patient's favorites and conditions. The accuracy of the recommended menu was  assessed in 2 steps. First, it was compared with the diet prescribed by three  nutrition specialists. In the second step, system's suggested menu was evaluated by  the data from 30 diabetic patients using a valid questionnaire. RESULTS: The results  of evaluating the snack recommender system by nutritionists showed that this system  is capable of recommending various snacks according to the season (accuracy of 100%)  and personal interests (accuracy of 90%) to diabetic patients. According to health  nutritionists, the snacks suggested by this system are matched with Iranian culture.  Moreover, the results revealed that a higher body mass index (BMI) makes the  recommender system less sensitive to personal interests to suggest what is basically  beneficial for one's health. CONCLUSION: This study was a pioneering research to  develop a more comprehensive dietary recommender system for diabetic patients which  includes main meals as well. Patients found the system useful and were satisfied  with the application. This system is believed to be able to help diabetic patients  to take more healthy diet which leads to a better lifestyle.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) emitted by cellular telephones may cause  neurological ill effects like cognitive dysfunction, emotional instability, and even  brain tumors. Slowing of brain activity on electroencephalography (EEG) has been  shown. However, these findings need further validation. AIMS: EEG changes and  adverse effects experienced following cell-phone use were studied. SETTINGS AND  DESIGN: The study was conducted in the Department of Neurology of a tertiary care  university hospital in India on North Indian students of the University, from August  2017 to October 2017. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one students underwent video-EEG  recording before and after application of Samsung GT-56312 dual SIM smart phone in  switched off, switched on, and switched on mode with conversation. STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS USED: Average EEG frequencies and amplitudes were calculated for different  brain regions. Chi-square tests and t-tests were used for comparison between  variables. RESULTS: The mean age of 7 (33.3%) male and 14 (66.7%) female subjects  was 20.76 ± 1.48 years. The average EEG frequencies following mobile phone  application with conversation were higher and the amplitudes lower than the baseline  values. Frequencies were greater on the right side. Slow waves were detected in the  frontal region in 38.1%, in the parietal region in 33.3%, in the occipital and  temporal region in 19.1%; and, generalized slow waves were seen in 9.5% students.  During the experiment, 23.8% experienced headache, 19% experienced irritation, and  9.5% felt drowsy. Headache and loss of concentration (33.3%), sleep disturbances  (28.6%), and fatigue (19%) were frequent in daily life. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental  application of mobile phones may lead to some EEG changes and certain ill effects on  the well-being. Hence, prolonged use of these gadgets warrants caution.

AB  - Approximately 90 days of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) spreading originally from Wuhan,  China, and across the globe has led to a widespread chain of events with imminent  threats to the fragile relationship between community health and economic health.  Despite near hourly reporting on this crisis, there has been no regular, updated, or  accurate reporting of hospitalizations for COVID-19. It is known that many  test-positive individuals may not develop symptoms or have a mild self-limited viral  syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms.  However some individuals develop a more fulminant syndrome including viral  pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring oxygen, acute respiratory distress syndrome  requiring mechanical ventilation, and in substantial fractions leading to death  attributable to COVID-19. The pandemic is evolving in a clustered, non-inform  fashion resulting in many hospitals with preparedness but few or no cases, and  others that are completely overwhelmed. Thus, a considerable risk of spread when  personal protection equipment becomes exhausted and a large fraction of mortality in  those not offered mechanical ventilation are both attributable to a crisis due to  maldistribution of resources. The pandemic is amenable to self-reporting through a  mobile phone application that could obtain critical information on suspected cases  and report on the results of self testing and actions taken. The only method to  understand the clustering and the immediate hospital resource needs is mandatory,  uniform, daily reporting of hospital censuses of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital  wards and intensive care units. Current reports of hospitalizations are delayed,  uncertain, and wholly inadequate. This paper urges all the relevant stakeholders to  take up self-reporting and reporting of hospitalizations of COVID-19 as an urgent  task in combating this devastating pandemic.

T2  - Trials
AB  - BACKGROUND: A primary concern within the healthcare system is to make treatment more  accessible as well as attractive for the great majority of alcohol-dependent people  who feel reluctant to participate in the treatment programs available. This paper  presents the protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy  of two different technical devices (mobile phone application and breathalyzer) on  alcohol consumption. METHODS: The study is a three-armed RCT with follow-ups 3 and 6  months after randomization. In total, 375 adults (age 18+ years) diagnosed with  alcohol use disorder (AUD) will be invited to participate in a 3-month intervention.  The primary outcome is the number of days with heavy drinking, defined as four or  more standard drinks (12 g alcohol/drink) and measured by the timeline follow back  (TLFB) and Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) instruments at 3-month  and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include weekly alcohol  consumption, measured by the TLFB, AUDIT, and phosphatidylethanol in blood values at  3-month and 6-month follow-up (number of days with blood alcohol concentration  levels exceeding 60 mg/100 ml). DISCUSSION: Improving ways of collecting data on  alcohol consumption, as well as the treatment system with regards to AUD, is of  vital importance. Mobile phone technology, with associated applications, is widely  recognized as a potentially powerful tool in the prevention and management of  disease. This study will provide unique knowledge regarding the use of new  technology as instruments for measuring alcohol consumption and, also, as a possible  way to decrease it.

AB  - Hospitalization for heart failure (HF) places a major burden on healthcare services  worldwide, and is a strong predictor of increased mortality especially in the first  three months after discharge. Though undesirable, hospitalization is an opportunity  to optimize HF therapy and advise clinicians and patients about the importance of  continued adherence to HF medication and regular monitoring. The Optimize Heart  Failure Care Program (www.optimize-hf.com), which has been implemented in 45  countries, is designed to improve outcomes following HF hospitalization through  inexpensive initiatives to improve prescription of appropriate drug therapies,  patient education and engagement, and post-discharge planning. It includes best  practice clinical protocols for local adaptation, pre- and post-discharge  checklists, and 'My HF Passport', a printed and smart phone application to improve  patient understanding of HF and encourage involvement in care and treatment  adherence. Early experience of the Program suggests that factors leading to  successful implementation include support from HF specialists or 'local leaders',  regular educational meetings for participating healthcare professionals,  multidisciplinary collaboration, and full integration of pre- and post-hospital  discharge checklists across care services. The Program is helping to raise awareness  of HF and generate useful data on current practice. It is showing how good  evidence-based care can be achieved through the use of simple clinician and  patient-focused tools. Preliminary results suggest that optimization of HF  pharmacological therapy is achievable through the Program, with little new  investment. Further data collection will lead to a greater understanding of the  impact of the Program on HF care and key indicators of success.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major public health issue and has large impact on the lives  of many people. Innovative technologies such as smartphones could create new  possibilities for suicide prevention, such as helping to overcome the barriers and  stigma on help seeking in case of suicidal ideation. Due to their omnipresence,  smartphone apps can offer suicide prevention tools very fast, they are  easily-accessible, low-threshold and can help overcome some of the help-seeking  barriers suicidal people experience. This article describes the development, testing  and implementation of a mobile application for coping with suicidal crisis: BackUp.  METHODS: Based on the analysis of literature and existing suicide prevention apps  several tools were identified as relevant to include in a suicide prevention app.  The selected tools (a safety planning tool, a hope box, a coping cards module, and a  module to reach out) are evidence based in a face to face context, and could be  easily transferred into a mobile app. The testing of existing apps and the  literature also revealed important guidelines for the technical development of the  application. RESULTS: BackUp was developed and tested by an expert panel (n = 9) and  a panel of end users (n = 21). Both groups rated BackUp as valuable for suicide  prevention. Suicidal ideation of the end user group was measured using the Beck  Scale for Suicidal Ideation before and after testing BackUp, and showed a small but  non-significant decrease. The majority of the testers used BackUp several times. All  tools were evaluated as rather or very useable in times of suicidal crisis.  CONCLUSION: BackUp was positively evaluated and indicates that self-help tools can  have a positive impact on suicidal ideation. Apps in particular create opportunities  in approaching people that are not reached by traditional interventions; on the  other hand they can contribute to suicide prevention in addition to regular care.  However, more research is needed on the impact and effect of suicide prevention  apps.

AB  - Background: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing worldwide. Identifying  and targeting individuals at high risk, is essential for preventing T2D. Several  studies point to mobile health initiatives delivered through personal smart devices  being a promising approach to diabetes prevention, through weight loss. The aim of  the mobile health and diabetes (mDiab) trial was twofold: to achieve 5% weight loss  and to look at the association of weight loss with degree of engagement with the  mDiab app. Methods: The mDiab randomized control trial was carried out among  smartphone users who are at high risk for T2D mellitus in three cities-Chennai,  Bengaluru, and New Delhi in India. The intervention was delivered through a mobile  phone application along with weekly coach calls for 12 weeks. While individuals in  the intervention group individuals received the app, which enabled tracking their  weight, physical activity, and diet along with 12 weekly video lessons on T2D  prevention and coach calls, the control group received usual care. Results: The  intervention group experienced a significant 1 kg weight loss while the control  group lost 0.3 kg (P < 0.05). More individuals in the intervention group (n = 139,  15%) met the 5% weight loss target than in the control group (n = 131, 9%). In the  intervention group those who viewed the videos experienced greater weight loss  (2.4 kg) than those who only attended coach calls (0.9 kg) (P < 0.01). Conclusions:  An mHealth intervention helped to achieve moderate weight loss. Future studies  should explore the sustainability of this weight loss.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Changes in the weather influence symptom severity in Ménière's disease  (MD). BACKGROUND: MD is an unpredictable condition that significantly impacts on  quality of life. It is suggested that fluctuations in the weather, especially  atmospheric pressure may influence the symptoms of MD. However, to date, limited  research has investigated the impact of the weather on MD. METHODS: In a  longitudinal study, a mobile phone application collected data from 397 individuals  (277 females and 120 males with an average age of 50 yr) from the UK reporting  consultant-diagnosed MD. Daily symptoms (vertigo, aural fullness, tinnitus, hearing  loss, and attack prevalence) and GPS locations were collected; these data were  linked with Met Office weather data (including atmospheric pressure, humidity,  temperature, visibility, and wind speed). RESULTS: Symptom severity and attack  prevalence were reduced on days when atmospheric pressure was higher. When  atmospheric pressure was below 1,013 hectopascals, the risk of an attack was 1.30  (95% confidence interval: 1.10, 1.54); when the humidity was above 90%, the risk of  an attack was 1.26 (95% confidence interval 1.06, 1.49). CONCLUSION: This study  provides the strongest evidence to date that changes in atmospheric pressure and  humidity are associated with symptom exacerbation in MD. Improving our understanding  of the role of weather and other environmental triggers in Ménière's may reduce the  uncertainty associated with living with this condition, significantly contributing  to improved quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of smartphone applications to monitor heart rate has become  increasingly popular. However, there is limited research available on the validity  of these applications. The purpose of this study was to examine the accuracy of a  free heart rate monitoring application on two smartphone platforms while at rest and  during moderate intensity exercise. One heart rate monitor application was chosen  for two different technological platforms. METHODS: Twenty-four adults aged 18 and  older (six males, 18 females) were randomly assigned a platform. Two groups were  formed based on the platform being utilized. Both groups were monitored using an  electrocardiograph (ECG) and the smart phone application. Heart rate for each  participant was recorded while seated before exercise, and during moderate intensity  exercise on an elliptical machine. Measurements were recorded in one-minute  intervals. RESULTS: Data was analyzed using correlations and t-tests between  platforms. All data was analyzed for both resting and exercise heart rate averages.  There was no significant difference in heart rate while seated, t-test (-1.33;  P=0.197) nor exercise heart rate, t-test (-1.54; P=0.142) when comparing means of  the two platforms to an ECG. CONCLUSIONS: The applications chosen for both platforms  to monitor heart rate were found to be fairly accurate, especially at rest. There  are small user adaptations for monitoring heart rate, but heart rate applications  provide a low-cost and efficient method for non-medical heart rate tracking. Future  research should investigate the difference in accuracy for skin tone, ethnicity,  race, hand size, and callosity of fingertips.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness meditation (MM) is a commonly used psychological  intervention for pain, mood, and anxiety conditions, but can be challenging to  practice with severe symptoms without proper training. The Mindfulness Meditation  app (MMA) is a supportive training tool specifically developed for this study to aid  in the practice of mindful breathing using a smartphone. OBJECTIVE: This study aims  to evaluate the psychophysiological effects of the MMA. Specifically, the study will  assess parasympathetic functioning using heart rate variability (HRV; primary  outcome), pain and mood symptoms, mind-wandering and present moment awareness, and  breath focus in groups of undergraduate participants who self-report  clinically-relevant symptoms of chronic pain (CP) and depression or anxiety (DA) and  condition-free (CF) participants who do not meet either criteria. We hypothesize  that use of the MMA by study groups will lead to improved HRV, pain, and mood  symptoms compared with groups who do not use the app. METHODS: This study is a  two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) recruiting through a Web-based research  participation pool at York University in Toronto, Canada. We are aiming for minimum  60 participants in each of CP, DA, and CF groups. Upon arriving to the laboratory,  participants will be prescreened for classification into groups of CP, DA, or CF.  Groups will be randomly assigned by a 1:1 ratio to an MMA (MMA+) condition or MM  condition without the app (MMA-) after a brief stress induction procedure. In MMA+,  participants will practice mindful breathing with a smartphone and press breath or  other buttons at the sound of audio tones if their awareness was on breathing or  another experience, respectively. HRV and respiration data will be obtained during  rest (5 min), stress induction (5 min), and meditation conditions (12 min).  Participants will complete psychological self-report inventories before and after  the stress induction and after the meditation condition. Separate linear mixed  models will be used to examine HRV and self-report inventories comparing groups and  treatment conditions. RESULTS: Recruitment for the study began in November 2017 and  is expected to be completed in winter of 2019-2020. As of July 2019, 189  participants have been recruited. The study's main findings are expected to reveal a  positive pattern of HRV responses in the CP, DA, and CF groups, such that a  significant increase in HRV (P<.05) is detected in those randomized to the MMA+  condition in comparison with those randomized to the MMA- condition. CONCLUSIONS:  This RCT will contribute to the burgeoning health psychology literature regarding  the clinical relevance of HRV in assessment and treatment of psychological and  medical conditions. Furthermore, possible ways to inform designs of MM training  tools delivered by apps and Web platforms for CP, depression, and anxiety  conditions' treatment will be discussed.

AB  - Breast cancer patients showed low engagement in physical activity (PA) during  chemotherapy. Evidence showed regular PA has potential to reduce mortality and risks  of cancer recurrence, relieve psychological distress, manage symptoms and improve  quality of life. Mobile health intervention displays a great advantage to deliver  cancer care timely and remotely. A Mobile Physical Activity Program was constructed  in a mobile phone application. The application contained 5 modes: information  delivering, disease tracking, events reminders, online interaction, health behavior  recording (daily walking steps, sleeping time and body weight) and self-reported  assessment. Both applications and web-based administration portal were developed by  engineers.

AB  - The use of heart rate variability (HRV) for monitoring stress has been growing in  the behavioral health literature, especially in the areas of posttraumatic stress  disorder, stress reactivity, and resilience. Few studies, however, have included  general populations under workplace conditions. This study evaluates whether  military and other first responders show lower HRV during stress than at baseline  and greater post stress rebound, controlling for a myriad of potential confounders.  A convenience sample of Reserves, National Guard, veteran, fire, and police  personnel provided HRV and self-reported questionnaire responses before, during, and  after a cognitive-stressor task with a smart phone application. Timing of HRV  application; mental and physical health scores; coping and posttraumatic growth  indicators, including being open to new possibilities; and emotional support were  predictors of trajectories of the HRV response to stress. Findings from this  exploratory study emphasize the strong link between stress and relaxation breathing  in both respiratory sinus arrhythmia and low frequency heart rate variability and  the need for controlling potential covariates for understanding the relationship  between HRV and the stress response and providing a basis for hypothesis driven  research.

T2  - Systematic reviews
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many of the adverse outcomes experienced by mothers and babies are  directly related to the health of the woman prior to pregnancy. This preconception  period is a unique window of opportunity when women are often more motivated to  optimise health and change their lifestyle in preparation for pregnancy. Several  risk factors in the preconception period can contribute to adverse perinatal  outcomes. These risk factors can be divided into three broad areas: biomedical,  social and environmental. Mobile phone applications as a behaviour change  intervention have the potential to address these risks through supporting the  provision of information, healthier lifestyles and informed decision-making. The aim  of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of mobile phone  applications in promoting behaviour change and improving long-term outcomes for  mother and babies, in women of reproductive age. METHODS: This review will include  trials that assess any mobile phone application (app) that assist women of  reproductive age to optimise health behaviours. Randomised controlled trials,  quasi-randomised controlled trials and cluster-randomised trials will be included.  The search strategy will use both MeSH and keyword combinations to search databases  including the WHO Global Health Library, CINHAL, The Cochrane Library, Embase and  MEDLINE for relevant studies. Retrieved citations will be screened independently by  two authors to assess eligibility. Studies will be selected only if the intervention  was commenced prior to pregnancy. Comparisons will be made including mobile phone  applications versus text messaging-based communications or paper-based, face-to-face  or telephone conversations and standard care or no specific intervention. The  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions will be utilised to assess  the quality of included randomised studies. Primary and secondary outcomes will be  compared and analysed. Results of the review will be reported using the Preferred  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P)  guidelines. DISCUSSION: This systematic review is the first to assess the effects of  preconception mobile phone app behaviour change and educational interventions in  improving future pregnancy and maternal and child outcomes, in women of reproductive  age.

AB  - We aimed to assess the accuracy of self-assessment for acute stroke patients via  mobile phone application-based scales and determine the value and prospect of  clinical use.A cross-sectional study was designed and acute stroke patients were  enrolled. We pushed the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and activities of daily living  (ADL) scale to patients via mobile phone application for self-assessment on the day  before they were out of hospital. We compared the results from nurse assessment and  self-assessment.Around 50 patients with the average age 51.72 ± 12.40 completed the  self-assessment. A total of 27 patients self-assessed the scales, while caregivers  of other 23 patients completed the assessment. In comparison with patient assessment  and nurse assessment, significant difference was found in ADL score (P = .004), but  was not found in mRS score (P > .05). When comparing caregiver assessment with nurse  assessment, no significant difference could be found either in ADL score (P > .05)  or in mRS score (P > .05). The kappa value for self-assessment and nurse agreement  of ADL was 0.720 (P = .000), with sensitivity 96.8% and specificity 82.0%. The kappa  value for self-assessment and nurse agreement of mRS was 0.718 (P = .000), with  sensitivity 97.6% and specificity 92.4%.In summary, mobile phone application-based  scales are generally accurate, economical and convenient for self-assessment of  acute stroke patients with acceptable reliability in our small scale study.  Caregivers can serve as the proper assessor when patients are out of hospital.  Therefore, it is promising but still need to be further confirmed how practical to  use this application in extended care and follow-up.

AB  - Introduction: Variable airflow obstruction that can be confirmed by diurnal  variability of peak expiratory flow (PEF) >13% is an important characteristic of  asthma. Home monitoring of PEF may be helpful to diagnose and monitor asthma. In  this feasibility study, we aimed to study if asthmatic children can measure PEF at  home twice daily during a 4-week period using a device designed as a "whistle" and a  smart phone software application. Materials and Methods: Twice daily during 4 weeks,  children aged 5-12 years with current asthma rated their asthma condition  electronically on the smart phone application Blowfish before inhaling deeply then  exhaling into the device to produce a high-pitched sound recorded by the  application. Through mathematical algorithms, the sound was transferred to PEF,  which was uploaded to a server. At inclusion, the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life  Questionnaire and the Childhood Asthma Control Test were answered. At the end, the  parents graded the device and application. Results: One child did not manage to  upload PEF. For the remaining 21 children, the median (quartiles) days with at least  one measurement during the period were 27 (21-29.5), and on median 18 (9-24) days  PEF was recorded twice daily. The median parental score (potential score 0-20) of  the application was 18 (15-20). Discussion/Conclusion: The study shows promising  results for home monitoring of PEF by an electronic device with automatic  teletransmission. The high rate of successful recordings and parental satisfaction  suggests that the clinical utility of the solution should be further studied.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, neonatal mortality accounts for nearly half of under-five  mortality, and intrapartum related events are a leading cause. Despite the rise in  neonatal resuscitation (NR) training programs in low- and middle-income countries,  their impact on the quality of NR skills amongst providers with limited formal  medical education, particularly those working in rural primary health centers  (PHCs), remains incompletely understood. METHODS: This study evaluates the impact of  PRONTO International simulation training on the quality of NR skills in simulated  resuscitations and live deliveries in rural PHCs throughout Bihar, India. Further,  it explores barriers to performance of key NR skills. PRONTO training was conducted  within CARE India's AMANAT intervention, a maternal and child health quality  improvement project. Performance in simulations was evaluated using video-recorded  assessment simulations at weeks 4 and 8 of training. Performance in live deliveries  was evaluated in real time using a mobile-phone application. Barriers were explored  through semi-structured interviews with simulation facilitators. RESULTS: In total,  1342 nurses participated in PRONTO training and 226 NR assessment simulations were  matched by PHC and evaluated. From week 4 to 8 of training, proper neck extension,  positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with chest rise, and assessment of heart rate  increased by 14%, 19%, and 12% respectively (all p ≤ 0.01). No difference was noted  in stimulation, suction, proper PPV rate, or time to completion of key steps. In 252  live deliveries, identification of non-vigorous neonates, use of suction, and use of  PPV increased by 21%, 25%, and 23% respectively (all p < 0.01) between weeks 1-3 and  4-8. Eighteen interviews revealed individual, logistical, and cultural barriers to  key NR skills. CONCLUSION: PRONTO simulation training had a positive impact on the  quality of key skills in simulated and live resuscitations throughout Bihar.  Nevertheless, there is need for ongoing improvement that will likely require both  further clinical training and addressing barriers that go beyond the scope of such  training. In settings where clinical outcome data is unreliable, data triangulation,  the process of synthesizing multiple data sources to generate a better-informed  evaluation, offers a powerful tool for guiding this process.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adopt a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate a virtually supervised  home-based high-intensity interval training (Home-HIT) intervention in people with  type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eleven individuals with type 1  diabetes (seven women; age 30 ± 3 years; [Formula: see text] 2.5 ± 0.2 L/min;  duration of diabetes 10 ± 2 years) completed 6 weeks of Home-HIT. A heart rate  monitor and mobile phone application were used to provide feedback to the  participants and research team on exercise intensity (compliance) and adherence.  RESULTS: Training adherence was 95 ± 2%, and compliance was 99 ± 1%. Home-HIT  increased [Formula: see text] by 7% (P = 0.017) and decreased insulin dose by 13% (P  = 0.012). Blood glucose concentration did not change from baseline to immediately or  1 h post Home-HIT. Qualitative perceptions of Home-HIT and the virtual-monitoring  system were positive, supporting that the intervention successfully removed exercise  barriers in people with type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Virtually monitored Home-HIT  resulted in high adherence alongside increased [Formula: see text] and decreased  insulin dose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite high rates of smartphone ownership in psychiatric populations,  there are very little data available characterizing smartphone use in individuals  with mental illness. In particular, few studies have examined the interest and use  of smartphones to support mental health. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1)  characterize general smartphone app and social media usage in an acute  transdiagnostic psychiatric sample with high smartphone ownership, (2) characterize  current engagement and interest in the use of smartphone apps to support mental  health, and (3) test demographic and clinical predictors of smartphone use. METHODS:  The survey was completed by all patients attending an adult partial hospital  program, with no exclusion criteria. The primary outcomes were frequency of use of  general and mental health smartphone apps (smartphone use survey) and the frequency  of social media use and phone-checking behavior (mobile technology engagement  scale). RESULTS: Overall, 322 patients (aged mean 33.49, SD 13.87 years; 57% female)  reported that their most frequently used app functions were texting, email, and  social media. Younger individuals reported more frequent use across most types of  apps. Baseline depression and anxiety symptoms were not associated with the  frequency of app use. Participants reported health care, calendar, and texting apps  as most supportive of their mental health and social media apps as most negatively  affecting their mental health. Most patients reported an interest in (73.9%  [238/322]) and willingness to use (81.3% [262/322]) a smartphone app to monitor  their mental health condition. Less than half (44%) of the patients currently had a  mental health app downloaded on their smartphone, with mindfulness and meditation  apps being the most common type. CONCLUSIONS: The high interest in and willingness  to use mental health apps, paired with the only moderate current reported usage,  indicate a potential unmet treatment opportunity in psychiatric populations. There  is potential to optimize non-mental health-specific apps to better support the needs  of those with mental illness and to design a new wave of mental health apps that  match the needs of these populations as well as the way they use smartphones in  daily life.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The high incidence of skin cancer in Brazil has resulted in an urgent  need for more efficient methods of reducing the time between initial diagnosis and  therapy. Such delays are significant in large countries like Brazil, where a  considerable proportion of the population live in remote areas with limited access  to specialized medical care. To address this problem the use of mobile phones as  screening devices for suspicious skin lesions has been incorporated as long-distance  teledermatology services. Digital photography is now a convenient ancillary option  to minimize treatment delays caused by the distance between the specialist doctor  and patients. The authors have developed a friendly mobile application and website  to take high quality digital images of suspicious lesions, and to capture patient  data easily and quickly to be analyzed by skin cancer professionals at another  location. METHODS: This was a prospective study of a population of 39 individuals  monitored by routine skin cancer screening by the Cancer Prevention Department at  Barretos Cancer Hospital during 2016. All patients were evaluated in the dermatology  clinic, where a differential diagnosis was made based on the clinical information  and direct examination of suspicious lesions. A second dermatologist assessed the  same clinical information and digital images of all lesions captured by  teledermatology, and provided an independent diagnostic opinion on the likelihood of  the lesions being benign or suggestive of malignancy. The diagnostic efficiencies of  teledermatology and standard dermatology were then compared to the histopathological  findings of each biopsy as the diagnostic gold standard, and then statistical  parameters of each approach were evaluated. RESULTS: The lesions studied in this  comparison were mostly found on the face (69%), followed by upper limbs (15%), scalp  (8%), trunk (6%) and lower limbs (2%). Final histopathological analyses of the  biopsies in the study group showed that 71% of lesions were malignant, with 32%  being squamous cell carcinoma and 68% being classified as basal cell carcinoma, and  29% were considered benign lesions. The overall sensitivities of teledermatology in  comparison to face-to-face evaluation in the clinic were similar (clinic, 80.0%;  teledermatology, 80.8%). Other comparisons including accuracy (clinic, 78.9%;  teledermatology, 79.5%); specificity (clinic, 76.9%; teledermatology, 76.9%);  positive predictive value (clinic, 87.0%; teledermatology, 87.5%); and negative  predictive value (clinic, 66.7.0%; teledermatology, 66.7%) all showed equivalence.  The inter-observer kappa value between face-to-face examination and teledermatology  showed excellent agreement at 0.958. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings indicate  that the cell phone application developed to aid the diagnosis of skin cancer showed  great potential and reliability, and can therefore be considered as an ancillary  option in countries like Brazil, with isolated communities that have limited access  to dermatology clinics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a worldwide disorder that affects millions of people  and can exert negative clinical and social effects on the patients. In some previous  studies, mobile health applications have been used as a means of clinical  intervention. However, the therapeutic effect of continuous care through mobile  phone applications for patients with type 2 diabetes remains unclear. OBJECTIVE:  This study aimed to explore the clinical effect of continuous care for patients with  type 2 diabetes using mobile health application by comparing traditional discharge  nursing. METHODS: In total, 120 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly divided  into two groups: The test group received continuous care based on the mobile phone  application (n = 60), and the control group received conventional care (n = 60).  Primary clinical outcomes, such as Glycaemic Haemoglobin (GH) levels, blood glucose  levels, self-care abilities, disease cognition abilities, and the number of  readmissions, were examined in both groups. RESULTS: The results showed significant  improvements pertaining to disease awareness levels (81.28 vs 71.34, P < .05),  self-management abilities (9.14 vs 7.81, P < .05), GH (-1.50% vs -0.76%, P < .05),  fast blood glucose (-3.23 vs -1.25 mmol/L, P < .05), postprandial blood glucose  levels (-4.34 vs -2.34 mmol, P < .05), and control levels in the test group.  Moreover, in the test group, the frequency of rehospitalisation was reduced during  the intervention period, as was the average number of rehospitalisation within 6  months after discharge (-1.19 vs P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous care based on a  mobile health application has potential as a management strategy for patients with  type 2 diabetes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infants born extremely preterm (EP; <28 weeks' gestation) and/or with  extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1000 g birth weight) are at increased risk for  adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, it is challenging to predict those  EP/ELBW infants destined to have long-term neurodevelopmental impairments in order  to target early intervention to those in most need. The General Movements Assessment  (GMA) in early infancy has high predictive validity for neurodevelopmental outcomes  in preterm infants. However, access to a GMA may be limited by geographical  constraints and a lack of GMA-trained health professionals. Baby Moves is a  smartphone application (app) developed for caregivers to video and upload their  infant's general movements to be scored remotely by a certified GMA assessor. The  aim of this study is to determine the predictive ability of using the GMA via the  Baby Moves app for neurodevelopmental impairment in infants born EP/ELBW. METHODS  AND ANALYSIS: This prospective cohort study will recruit infants born EP/ELBW across  the state of Victoria, Australia in 2016 and 2017. A control group of normal birth  weight (>2500 g birth weight), term-born (≥37 weeks' gestation) infants will also be  recruited as a local reference group. Parents will video their infant's general  movements at two time points between 3 and 4 months' corrected age using the Baby  Moves app. Videos will be scored by certified GMA assessors and classified as normal  or abnormal. Parental satisfaction using the Baby Moves app will be assessed via  survey. Neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years' corrected age includes developmental  delay according to the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III and  cerebral palsy diagnosis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the  Human Research and Ethics Committees at the Royal Children's Hospital, The Royal  Women's Hospital, Monash Health and Mercy Health in Melbourne, Australia. Study  findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and conference  presentations.

AB  - We examined the accuracy of Smart Socks - a device that measures foot pressure  during gait for detecting step-count across various walking speeds. Thirty-six  participants (17 men; 19 women) wore Smart Socks (Sock), a pedometer (Pedometer),  and a smartphone with a commercially available Phone Application (Phone) pedometer  to measure step-count during 3-min of treadmill or over-ground walking at 1.3, 2.2,  3.0, 3.8, and 4.7 km/h. Steps were compared to a gold-standard tally-counter  (Count), collected by independent assessors. All devices (Sock, Pedometer, and  Phone) underestimated step-count when compared to Count at 1.3 km/h (p<0.05);  however, Sock (27±18%) demonstrated a lower percent error compared to Phone (40±28%)  and Pedometer (98±5%) (both p<0.01). At 2.2 km/h, Sock was not different compared to  Count (Sock: 213±39; Count: 229±24 steps, p=0.25); however, both Phone (271±55  steps) and Pedometer (169±166 steps) were different compared to Count (p<0.05). At  3.0 km/h, both Sock (258±30 steps) and Pedometer (254±45 steps) were similar to  Count (267±22 steps) (p>0.05); however, Phone (291±28 steps) overestimated  step-count (p<0.01). All devices (Sock, Pedometer, and Phone) were similar to Count  at 3.8, and 4.7 km/h (p>0.05). These findings demonstrate that Smart Socks are more  accurate than pedometers used in the present study for detecting step-count during  treadmill or over-ground ambulation at slower walking speeds.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulse pressure variation (PPV) can be used to assess fluid status in the  operating room. This measurement, however, is time consuming when done manually and  unreliable through visual assessment. Moreover, its continuous monitoring requires  the use of expensive devices. Capstesia™ is a novel Android™/iOS™ application, which  calculates PPV from a digital picture of the arterial pressure waveform obtained  from any monitor. The application identifies the peaks and troughs of the arterial  curve, determines maximum and minimum pulse pressures, and computes PPV. In this  study, we compared the accuracy of PPV generated with the smartphone application  Capstesia (PPVapp) against the reference method that is the manual determination of  PPV (PPVman). METHODS: The Capstesia application was loaded onto a Samsung Galaxy S4  phone. A physiologic simulator including PPV was used to display arterial waveforms  on a computer screen. Data were obtained with different sweep speeds (6 and 12 mm/s)  and randomly generated PPV values (from 2% to 24%), pulse pressure (30, 45, and 60  mm Hg), heart rates (60-80 bpm), and respiratory rates (10-15 breaths/min) on the  simulator. Each metric was recorded 5 times at an arterial height scale X1  (PPV5appX1) and 5 times at an arterial height scale X3 (PPV5appX3). Reproducibility  of PPVapp and PPVman was determined from the 5 pictures of the same hemodynamic  profile. The effect of sweep speed, arterial waveform scale (X1 or X3), and number  of images captured was assessed by a Bland-Altman analysis. The measurement error  (ME) was calculated for each pair of data. A receiver operating characteristic curve  analysis determined the ability of PPVapp to discriminate a PPVman > 13%. RESULTS:  Four hundred eight pairs of PPVapp and PPVman were analyzed. The reproducibility of  PPVapp and PPVman was 10% (interquartile range, 7%-14%) and 6% (interquartile range,  3%-10%), respectively, allowing a threshold ME of 12%. The overall mean bias for  PPVappX1 was 1.1% within limits of -1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.7 to  -1.1) to +3.5% (95% CI, +3.2 to +3.8). Averaging 5 values of PPVappX1 with a sweep  speed of 12 mm/s resulted in the smallest bias (+0.6%) and the best limits of  agreement (±1.3%). ME of PPVapp was <12% whenever 3, 4, or 5 pictures were taken to  average PPVapp. The best predictive value for PPVapp to detect a PPVman > 13% was  obtained for PPVappX1 by averaging 5 pictures showing a PPVapp threshold of 13.5%  (95% CI, 12.9-15.2) and a receiver operating characteristic curve area of 0.989 (95%  CI, 0.963-0.998) with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 94%. CONCLUSIONS:  Our findings show that the Capstesia PPV calculation is a dependable substitute for  standard manual PPV determination in a highly controlled environment (simulator  study). Further studies are warranted to validate this mobile feature extraction  technology to predict fluid responsiveness in real conditions.

T2  - Eating behaviors
AB  - We developed a smart phone application to measure participants' food-reward  perceptions and eating behavior in their naturalistic environment. Intensity ratings  (0 - not at all to 10 - very strongly) of perceived anticipation of food (wanting)  and food enjoyment at endpoint of intake (liking) were recorded as they occurred  over a period of 14 days. Moreover, food craving trait, implicit and explicit  attitude towards healthy food, and body composition were assessed. 53 participants  provided complete data. Participants were classified by percentage of body fat; 33  participants with lower body fat (L-group) and 20 with higher body fat (H-group;  ≥25% body fat for males and ≥32% for females). L-group participants reported 6.34  (2.00) food wanting events per day, whereas H-group participants recorded  significantly fewer food wanting events (5.07 (1.42)); both groups resisted about  the same percentage of wanting events (L-group: 29.2 (15.5)%; H-group 27.3 (12.8)%).  Perceived intensity ratings were significantly different within the L-group in the  order liking (7.65 (0.81)) > un-resisted wanting (leading to eating) (7.00  (1.01)) > resisted wanting (not leading to eating) (6.02 (1.72)) but not in the  H-group. Liking scores (L-group: 7.65 (0.81); H-group: 7.14 (1.04)) were  significantly higher in L-group than in H-group after controlling for age. Our  results show that individuals with higher percentage of body fat show less food  enjoyment after intake and reveal no differentiation in intensity ratings of  perceived anticipatory and consummatory food reward. These results are consistent  with a hypothesized reward deficiency among individuals with higher percentage of  body fat.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate total body surface area burned (TBSAB) estimation is a crucial  aspect of early burn management. It helps guide resuscitation and is essential in  the calculation of fluid requirements. Conventional methods of estimation can often  lead to large discrepancies in burn percentage estimation. We aim to compare a new  method of TBSAB estimation using a three-dimensional smart-phone application named  3D Burn Resuscitation (3D Burn) against conventional methods of estimation-Rule of  Palm, Rule of Nines and the Lund and Browder chart. METHODS: Three volunteer  subjects were moulaged with simulated burn injuries of 25%, 30% and 35% total body  surface area (TBSA), respectively. Various healthcare workers were invited to use  both the 3D Burn application as well as the conventional methods stated above to  estimate the volunteer subjects' burn percentages. RESULTS: Collective relative  estimations across the groups showed that when used, the Rule of Palm, Rule of Nines  and the Lund and Browder chart all over-estimated burns area by an average of 10.6%,  19.7%, and 8.3% TBSA, respectively, while the 3D Burn application under-estimated  burns by an average of 1.9%. There was a statistically significant difference  between the 3D Burn application estimations versus all three other modalities  (p < 0.05). Time of using the application was found to be significantly longer  than traditional methods of estimation. CONCLUSIONS: The 3D Burn application,  although slower, allowed more accurate TBSAB measurements when compared to  conventional methods. The validation study has shown that the 3D Burn application is  useful in improving the accuracy of TBSAB measurement. Further studies are  warranted, and there are plans to repeat the above study in a different centre  overseas as part of a multi-centre study, with a view of progressing to a  prospective study that compares the accuracy of the 3D Burn application against  conventional methods on actual burn patients.

T2  - Sexually transmitted diseases
AB  - BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) have a relatively high prevalence of  sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This study examines the association of  self-reported STIs and use of mobile phones and/or computer-based Internet to meet  sexual partners among black and Hispanic/Latino MSM in the United States. METHODS:  Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM (N = 853) were recruited from 3 US cities (Chicago,  IL; Kansas City, MO; and Fort Lauderdale, FL) via online and community outreach. Men  completed a computer-assisted, self-interview assessment on demographics, use of  mobile phones and computer-based Internet for sex-seeking, sexual risk behavior, and  self-reported bacterial STIs in the past year. Multivariable logistic regression was  used to model independent associations of STIs and use of these technologies to meet  sexual partners. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of the sample reported having an STI  in the past year; 29% reported using a mobile phone and 28% a computer-based  Internet mostly for sex-seeking; and 22% reported using both. Number of male sexual  partners (past year) was associated with any STI (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03; 95%  confidence interval, 1.01-1.06). Adjusting for human immunodeficiency virus status,  number of male sexual partners (past year), and demographic variables, men who  reported use of both mobile phones and computer-based Internet for sex-seeking had  increased odds of reporting an STI (adjusted odds ratio, 2.59; 95% confidence  interval, 1.75-3.83), as well as with separate reports of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and  syphilis (P's < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced community education regarding STI  prevention, testing, and treatment options are necessary among this subpopulation of  MSM who may benefit from messaging via Internet and mobile phone application sites.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding patterns of real-world usage of mental health apps is key  to maximizing their potential to increase public self-management of care. Although  developer-led studies have published results on the use of mental health apps in  real-world settings, no study yet has systematically examined usage patterns of a  large sample of mental health apps relying on independently collected data.  OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to present real-world objective data on user engagement with  popular mental health apps. METHODS: A systematic engine search was conducted using  Google Play to identify Android apps with 10,000 installs or more targeting anxiety,  depression, or emotional well-being. Coding of apps included primary incorporated  techniques and mental health focus. Behavioral data on real-world usage were  obtained from a panel that provides aggregated nonpersonal information on user  engagement with mobile apps. RESULTS: In total, 93 apps met the inclusion criteria  (installs: median 100,000, IQR 90,000). The median percentage of daily active users  (open rate) was 4.0% (IQR 4.7%) with a difference between trackers (median 6.3%, IQR  10.2%) and peer-support apps (median 17.0%) versus breathing exercise apps (median  1.6%, IQR 1.6%; all z≥3.42, all P<.001). Among active users, daily minutes of use  were significantly higher for mindfulness/meditation (median 21.47, IQR 15.00) and  peer support (median 35.08, n=2) apps than for apps incorporating other techniques  (tracker, breathing exercise, psychoeducation: medians range 3.53-8.32; all z≥2.11,  all P<.05). The medians of app 15-day and 30-day retention rates were 3.9% (IQR  10.3%) and 3.3% (IQR 6.2%), respectively. On day 30, peer support (median 8.9%,  n=2), mindfulness/meditation (median 4.7%, IQR 6.2%), and tracker apps (median 6.1%,  IQR 20.4%) had significantly higher retention rates than breathing exercise apps  (median 0.0%, IQR 0.0%; all z≥2.18, all P≤.04). The pattern of daily use presented a  descriptive peak toward the evening for apps incorporating most techniques (tracker,  psychoeducation, and peer support) except mindfulness/meditation, which exhibited  two peaks (morning and night). CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of app installs and  daily active minutes of use may seem high, only a small portion of users actually  used the apps for a long period of time. More studies using different datasets are  needed to understand this phenomenon and the ways in which users self-manage their  condition in real-world settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Traumatic dental injuries (TDI) are a public health problem, given  their prevalence and consequences. However, their epidemiology is uncertain due to a  general lack of quality data capture. The aim of this study was to evaluate the  validity and usability of a mobile phone-based application for community-based  surveillance of traumatic dental injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mobile  phone-based application, Dental Trauma Tracker (DTT), was developed. This system  involves a mobile application for general users to report TDIs and a Web application  for researchers to generate epidemiological data. The DTT evaluation used mixed  methods and was conducted in three phases: (a) validation of a trauma identification  system using preselected TDI images; (b) design evaluation by experts; and (c)  usability evaluation measured by the reporting of three fictitious TDI cases and  using the System Usability Scale (SUS). RESULTS: In the first phase, 182  participants participated. Most images showed over 95% accuracy, indicating that  they adequately represented the type of dentoalveolar trauma being evaluated  (κ = 0.75). The design evaluation identified nine usability problems-four of them  with a "High priority" to be fixed, four with "Low priority," and one "No fix  necessary." A total of 29 volunteers participated in the usability evaluation. The  mean time for users to complete all of the reports was 7.8 ± 3.0 minutes. Mean SUS  score was 67.4 ± 21.9 (Range: 0-100; worst to best). The global agreement between  cases registered with the gold standard was also "Substantial" (κ = 0.71).  CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary evaluation confirmed the App's usability, using a  sample of potential users, as well as reporting on the results of an expert panel  review of the DTT. These are the minimum requirements necessary before further  expansion and widespread implementation occurs to confirm these results.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic disease that decreases  mobility, function, and quality of life. This study introduced the "Smart-phone  SpondyloArthritis Management System" (SpAMS), an interactive mobile health (mHealth)  tool designed for AS/spondyloarthritis (SpA) disease management and used SpAMS data  to evaluate clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with AS. METHODS: SpAMS  integrates patient's and physician's portals in a smart phone application. The  Chinese Ankylosing Spondylitis Prospective Imaging Cohort was launched using SpAMS  in April 2016. Patient self-assessments were completed online at baseline and at  every subsequent clinic visit. Physician-reported assessments and treatments were  recorded by rheumatologists during each visit. RESULTS: In total, 1201 patients with  AS [mean (SD) age, 30.6 (8.7) years; male, 82.6%] were recruited. Mean (SD) disease  duration was 8.4 (6.1) years. Past or current symptoms of acute anterior uveitis  (AAU), psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were observed in 21.0%, 3.7%,  and 9.4% of patients, respectively. AAU and IBD occurred significantly more in  patients with symptom duration > 10 years. The most commonly used medications at  baseline were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (98.2%). Patients using tumour  necrosis factor inhibitors accounted for 20.8%, and 66.4% of patients used  conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. At baseline, 57.2% of  patients had inactive disease (ID)/low disease activity (LDA); this rate  significantly improved to 79.2% after a mean follow-up of 13.3 (5.9) months.  Compared with relapsed patients, new achievers of ID/LDA underwent more online  patient assessments (P < .001). Problems solved in SpAMS caused 29.1% of clinic  visits to a tertiary hospital unnecessary. SpAMS saved an average of 5.3 hours and  327.4 RMB per person on traffic expenses; these expenses equalled 16% of the Chinese  monthly disposable personal income. CONCLUSIONS: SpAMS is a time- and cost-saving  disease management tool that can help patients with AS perform self-management and  provide valuable data to clinicians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Burnout (encompassing emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and  personal accomplishment) in healthcare professionals is a major issue worldwide.  Emergency medicine physicians are particularly affected, potentially impacting on  quality of care and attrition from the specialty. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study  was to apply an attention-based training (ABT) program to reduce burnout among  emergency multidisciplinary team (MDT) members from a large urban hospital. DESIGN,  SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Emergency MDT members were randomized to  either a no-treatment control or an intervention group. Intervention group  participants engaged in a four session (4 h/session) ABT program over 7 weeks with a  practice target of 20 min twice-daily. Practice adherence was measured using a smart  phone application together with a wearable Charge 2 device. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:  The primary outcome was a change in burnout, comprising emotional exhaustion,  depersonalization and personal achievement. The secondary outcomes were changes in  other psychological and biometric parameters. RESULTS: The ABT program resulted in a  significant reduction (P < 0.05; T1 [one week before intervention] vs T3 [follow-up  at two months after intervention]) in burnout, specifically, emotional exhaustion,  with an effect size (probability of superiority) of 59%. Similar reductions were  observed for stress (P < 0.05) and anxiety (P < 0.05). Furthermore, ABT group  participants demonstrated significant improvements in heart rate variability,  resting heart rate, sleep as well as an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine  expression. CONCLUSION: This study describes a positive impact of ABT on emergency  department staff burnout compared to a no-treatment control group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective management of migraine requires adherence to treatment  recommendations; however, adolescents with migraine take their daily medications  only 75% of the time. Low-cost adherence-focused interventions using technology may  improve adherence, but have not been investigated. METHODS: Thirty-five adolescents  and young adults (13-21 years) with migraine participated in an AB-design pilot  study to assess the use of a mobile phone adherence-promotion application ("app")  and progressive reminder system. Adherence was calculated using electronic  monitoring during the baseline period and medication adherence intervention.  RESULTS: Relative to baseline, adherence significantly improved during the first  month of the intervention. Specifically, improvements existed for older participants  with lower baseline adherence. Self-reported app-based adherence rates were  significantly lower than electronically monitored adherence rates. Participants  rated the intervention as acceptable and easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: "Apps" have the  potential to improve medication adherence and are a promising intervention for  adolescents and young adults with low adherence. Involving parents in the  intervention is also helpful. Providers should assess barriers to adherence and use  of technology-based interventions, encourage parents to incorporate behavioral  incentives, and provide referrals for more intensive interventions to improve  long-term outcomes. Further, tracking adherence in an app may result in an  underestimation of adherence. Future full-scale studies should be conducted to  examine adherence promotion app interventions.

AB  - [Purpose] To establish the test-retest reliability of an iPhone application and  determine the immediate effect of motor control exercise (MCE) on lumbar position  sense. [Participants and Methods] This study used a two-arm, randomized controlled  trial design with a blinded assessor. Sixty healthy participants were randomized  into the exercise or control group. The exercise group underwent 30-min MCE, whereas  the control group rested for 15 min. Lumbar motion measured by two iPhones with  goniometer application was used to determine the test-retest reliability. Absolute  repositioning errors (pre- and post-test) from the control and exercise groups were  used to determine the immediate effect of MCE on lumbar position sense. [Results]  The test-retest reliability was 0.67-0.95. A significant interaction effect was  found for Angle*Time, main effect of Angle, and main effect of Time. Post-hoc  comparison showed a significant improvement in position sense at 45° and 60° in the  exercise group. [Conclusion] The findings suggest that a mobile phone application  has the ability to detect changes in lumbar position sense between sessions that  exceed measurement error following MCE. One session of specific MCE can improve  lumbar position sense at high lumbar flexion.

TI  - Gut feeling: A grounded theory study to identify clinical educators' reasoning  processes in putting students on a learning contract.
AU  - El Hussein, Mohamed Toufic
AU  - Fast, Olive
T2  - Journal of clinical nursing
AB  - AIM: To develop a substantive theoretical explanation that makes sense of the  decision-making process that clinical instructors use to place students on a  learning contract. BACKGROUND: Clinical instructors are challenged with the task of  objectively evaluating students using subjective tools such as anecdotal notes,  diaries, unstructured observations and verbal feedback from other nurses. Clinical  instructors' assessment decisions have a considerable impact on a variety of key  stakeholders, not least of all students. DESIGN: Grounded theory method and its  heuristic tools including the logic of constant comparison, continuous memoing and  theoretical sampling to serve conceptualisation were used in the process of data  collection and analysis. METHODS: Seventeen individual semi-structured interviews  with clinical instructors in one university in Western Canada were conducted between  May 2016-May 2017. Data were analysed using open, axial and selective coding  consistent with grounded theory methodology. The study was checked for the Standards  for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) criteria (See Appendix S1). FINDINGS:  Three subcategories, "brewing trouble," "unpacking thinking" and "benchmarking" led  to the study's substantive theoretical explanation. "Gut feeling" demonstrates how  clinical instructors reason in their decision-making process to place a student on a  learning contract. CONCLUSION: Placing a student on a learning contract is impacted  by personal, professional and institutional variables that together shift the  process of evaluation towards subjectivity, thus influencing students' competency. A  system-level approach, focusing on positive change through implementing innovative  assessment strategies, such as using a smart phone application, is needed to provide  some degree of consistency and objectivity. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Making  visible the objective assessments currently being done by clinical instructors has  the potential to change organisational standards, which in turn impact patient and  clinical outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphone apps are a potential mechanism for development of  self-management skills in people with persistent pain. However, the inclusion of  best-practice content items in available pain management apps fostering core  self-management skills for self-management support is not known. OBJECTIVE: The aim  of the study was to evaluate the contents of smartphone apps providing information  on pain management strategies for people with persistent pain facilitating  self-management support and to appraise the app quality. METHODS: A systematic  search was performed in the New Zealand App Store and Google Play Store. Apps were  included if they were designed for people with persistent pain, provided information  on pain self-management strategies, and were available in English. App contents were  evaluated using an a priori 14-item self-management support (SMS-14) checklist. App  quality was assessed using the 23-item Mobile Apps Rating Scale. RESULTS: Of the 939  apps screened, 19 apps met the inclusion criteria. Meditation and guided relaxation  were the most frequently included self-management strategies. Overall, the included  apps met a median of 4 (range 1-8) of the SMS-14 checklist. A total of 3 apps  (Curable, PainScale-Pain Diary and Coach, and SuperBetter) met the largest number of  items (8 out of 14) to foster self-management of pain. Self-monitoring of symptoms  (n=11) and self-tailoring of strategies (n=9) were frequently featured functions,  whereas a few apps had features facilitating social support and enabling  communicating with clinicians. No apps provided information tailored to the cultural  needs of the user. The app quality mean scores using Mobile Apps Rating Scale ranged  from 2.7 to 4.5 (out of 5.0). Although use of 2 apps (Headspace and SuperBetter) has  been shown to improve health outcomes, none of the included apps have been evaluated  in people with persistent pain. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 3 apps (Curable, PainScale-Pain  Diary and Coach, and SuperBetter) that met the largest number of items to support  skills in self-management of pain, 2 apps (PainScale-Pain Diary and Coach and  SuperBetter) were free, suggesting the potential for using apps as a scalable,  wide-reaching intervention to complement face-to-face care. However, none provided  culturally tailored information. Although 2 apps (Headspace and SuperBetter) were  validated to show improved health outcomes, none were tested in people with  persistent pain. Both users and clinicians should be aware of such limitations and  make informed choices in using or recommending apps as a self-management tool. For  better integration of apps in clinical practice, concerted efforts are required  among app developers, clinicians, and people with persistent pain in developing apps  and evaluating for clinical efficacy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors report on a pilot study of an inpatient intervention for  suicidal adolescents, As Safe as Possible (ASAP), supported by a smartphone app  (BRITE) to reduce suicide attempts following hospital discharge. METHOD: Across two  sites, 66 adolescents hospitalized for suicidal ideation (N=26) or a recent suicide  attempt (N=40) were randomly assigned to the ASAP intervention program plus  treatment as usual or to treatment as usual alone. ASAP, which focuses on emotion  regulation and safety planning, is a 3-hour intervention delivered on the inpatient  unit. The BRITE app prompted participants to rate their level of emotional distress  on a daily basis and provided personalized strategies for emotion regulation and  safety planning. A blind, independent evaluator assessed suicide attempts following  hospital discharge and suicidal ideation at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after discharge.  RESULTS: The ASAP intervention did not have a statistically significant effect on  suicide attempt, although findings were in the hypothesized direction for occurrence  of an attempt (16% compared with 31%; χ(2)=1.86, df=1, g=-0.36) and time to an  attempt (hazard ratio=0.49, 95% CI=0.16, 1.47). Past history of a suicide attempt  was a significant moderator of treatment outcome, with a stronger, albeit  nonsignificant, effect of the ASAP intervention among participants with a history of  suicide attempt (hazard ratio=0.23, 95% CI=0.05, 1.09). There were no treatment  effects on suicidal ideation. The majority of participants (70%) used the BRITE app  (median usage, 19 times). Participants reported high satisfaction with both the  intervention and the app. CONCLUSIONS: The ASAP intervention program shows promise  in reducing the incidence of postdischarge suicide attempts among adolescents  hospitalized for suicidality and merits further study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is the first-line of treatment for  overweight and obesity patients whose problems originate in maladaptive eating  habits (e.g., emotional eating). However, in-person CBT is currently difficult to  access by large segments of the population. The proposed SIGMA intervention (i.e.,  the Self-help, Integrated, and Gamified Mobile-phone Application) is a mHealth  intervention based on CBT principles. It specifically targets overweight young  adults with underlying maladaptive behaviors and cognitions regarding food. The  SIGMA app was designed as a serious game and intended to work as a standalone app  for weight maintenance or alongside a calorie-restrictive diet for weight loss. It  uses a complex and novel scoring system that allows points earned within the game to  be supplemented by points earned during outdoor activities with the help of an  embedded pedometer. METHODS/DESIGN: The efficacy of the SIGMA mHealth intervention  will be investigated within a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The intervention  will be set to last 2 months with a 3-month follow-up. Selected participants will be  young overweight adults with non-clinical maladaptive eating habits embodied by food  cravings, binge eating, and emotional eating. The primary outcomes will be  represented by changes in (1) self-reported maladaptive thoughts related to eating  and body weight, (2) self-reported maladaptive eating behaviors in the range of  urgent food cravings, emotional eating or binge eating, (3) as well as biased  attentional processing of food items as indexed by reaction times. Secondary  outcomes will be represented by changes in weight, Body Mass Index, general mood,  and physical activity as indexed by the number of steps per day. DISCUSSION: Through  an evidence-based cognitive behavioral approach and a user-friendly game interface,  the SIGMA intervention offers a significant contribution to the development of a  cost-effective and preventive self-help tool for young overweight adults with  maladaptive eating habits.

AB  - PURPOSE: Color matching a facial prosthesis to human skin is very challenging.  Colorimeters aid this process by adding objectivity to what is an otherwise  subjective procedure. Mobile phone colorimeter applications offer a less expensive  and widely available alternative to dedicated colorimeter devices for color  measurement. There is a lack of evidence in the literature regarding the suitability  of mobile phone colorimeter applications for the development of silicone shades for  facial prosthetics. The purpose of this study is to determine the suitability of a  mobile phone colorimeter application for matching natural skin colors during the  fabrication of maxillofacial prostheses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten pigmented  maxillofacial silicone elastomer swatches were fabricated to mimic a range of human  skin tones. Color measurements of these swatches were recorded using a test  instrument-the mobile phone colorimeter application (RGB Colorimeter) and a  reference instrument-the commercially available skin color measurement device e-skin  spectrocolorimeter. Comparisons in trueness and precision of the color measurements  were made using previously described methods. Data analysis was performed on the  recorded results for each of the parameters at three distances (25, 30, and 35 mm)  of the test instrument from the target against both a black and a white background.  RESULTS: The trueness of the mobile phone colorimeter application relative to the  colorimeter device varied depending on the distance from the target and the  background color. The relative trueness of the color difference measurements fell  just within the documented upper threshold of acceptable limits of color difference  (∆E 3.0 - 4.4). The calculated precision of the CIE L*a*b* and ∆E measurements of  the mobile phone colorimeter application was good, with the latter being well within  the documented acceptable limits. CONCLUSIONS: A mobile phone colorimeter  application would be a suitable aid in objectifying the process of color matching a  silicone maxillofacial prosthesis. Further investigation into image calibration to  improve trueness and the control of variables such as background noise, uniformity  of illumination, and measuring distance is required.

AB  - In field (on tree) fruit sizing has value in assessing crop health and for yield  estimation. As the mobile phone is a sensor and communication rich device carried by  almost all farm staff, an Android application ("FruitSize") was developed for  measurement of fruit size in field using the phone camera, with a typical assessment  rate of 240 fruit per hour achieved. The application was based on imaging of fruit  against a backboard with a scale using a mobile phone, with operational limits set  on camera to object plane angle and camera to object distance. Image processing and  object segmentation techniques available in the OpenCV library were used to segment  the fruit from background in images to obtain fruit sizes. Phone camera parameters  were accessed to allow calculation of fruit size, with camera to fruit perimeter  distance obtained from fruit allometric relationships between fruit thickness and  width. Phone geolocation data was also accessed, allowing for mapping fruits of  data. Under controlled lighting, RMSEs of 3.4, 3.8, 2.4, and 2.0 mm were achieved in  estimation of avocado, mandarin, navel orange, and apple fruit diameter,  respectively. For mango fruit, RMSEs of 5.3 and 3.7 mm were achieved on length and  width, benchmarked to manual caliper measurements, under controlled lighting, and  RMSEs of 5.5 and 4.6 mm were obtained in-field under ambient lighting.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by lay  people when guided by a mobile phone application with real-time feedback, with the  comparison of three different mobile phone applications (APPs). DESIGN: A  cross-sectional quasi-experimental study was carried out. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of  113 nursing students participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Three hands-only CPR  tests with continuous compressions were performed: (i)without external help;  (ii)with the mobile phone turned off; and (iii)guided by APP. Three different APPs  were randomly assigned (Pocket CPR®, CPR Pro®> and Massage cardiaque et DSA®). The  mannequin Laerdal Resusci Anne QCPR (Stavanger, Norway) 2.0.0.14 software was used.  VARIABLES OF PRIMARY INTEREST: APPs used. Demographic variables characterizing the  study sample. INDEPENDENT VARIABLES: mean depth, mean rate, percentage of correct  hand positioning, percentage of compressions with correct re-expansion, percentage  of compressions with correct depth, percentage of compressions at the correct rate,  and overall quality of CPR. RESULTS: Overall CPR quality was 33.3% ± 32.7 using  Pocket CPR, 10.9% ± 22.72% using CPR Pro and 7.8% ± 9.2 using Massage cardiaque et  DSA. None of the APPs produced a statistically significant improvement. The  percentage of time that the resuscitator managed to maintain a correct compression  rate improved when using all three APPs. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation  guided by phone APPs did not improve the overall quality of compressions during  resuscitation, though it improved the percentage of compressions performed at the  correct rate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the availability and use of mobile mental health apps has grown  exponentially in recent years, little data are available regarding their efficacy.  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an app developed to  promote stress management and well-being among working women compared with a control  app. METHODS: Female employees at a private hospital were invited to participate in  the study via mailing lists and intranet ads. A total of 653 individuals  self-enrolled through the website. Eligible participants were randomized between  control (n=240) and intervention (n=250) groups. The well-being mobile app provides  an 8-week program with 4 classes per week (including a brief theoretical portion and  a 15-min guided practice). The active control app also provided 4 assessments per  week that encouraged participants to self-observe how they were feeling for 20 min.  We also used the app to conduct Web-based questionnaires (10-item Perceived Stress  Scale and 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index) and ask specific  questions to assess subjective levels of stress and well-being at baseline (t(1)),  midintervention (t(4)=4 weeks after t(1)) and postintervention (t(8)=8 weeks after  t(1)). Both apps were fully automated without any human involvement. Outcomes from  the control and intervention conditions at the 3 time points were analyzed using a  repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Among the randomized participants  (n=490), 185 participants were excluded at the 4-week follow-up and another 79 at  the 8-week follow-up because of noncompliance with the experimental protocol.  Participants who did not complete t(4) and t(8) assessments were equally distributed  between groups (t(4): control group=34.6% [83/240] and intervention group=40.8%  [102/250]; P=.16; t(8): control group=29.9% [47/157] and intervention group=21.6%  [32/148]; P=.10). Both groups showed a significant increase in general well-being as  a function of time (F(2,426)=5.27; P=.006), but only the intervention group  presented a significant increase in work-related well-being (F(2,426)=8.92; P<.001),  as well as a significant reduction in work-related and overall stress  (F(2,426)=5.50; P=.004 and F(2,426)=8.59; P<.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The  well-being mobile app was effective in reducing employee stress and improving  well-being.

AB  - Although >10,000 behavioral health applications ("apps") are currently available on  the Apple and Google Play marketplaces, they have been minimally evaluated or  regulated and little is known about "real world" usage patterns. This investigation  combined data from online behavioral health app rating frameworks and a mobile  health market research firm to identify the most downloaded apps as well as  determine rating and ranking concordance between frameworks. Findings demonstrated  that the most commonly downloaded apps focus on relaxation, mindfulness, and  meditation skills and that they often have notably discordant reviews across rating  frameworks. Our results suggest that there is a growing need for: (1) standardized  behavioral health app quality and effectiveness measures, (2) up-to-date behavioral  health app guidance for clinicians and consumers, and (3) evidence-based apps that  incorporate revealed consumer preferences.

DESIGN: Nurse midwife mentors (NMMs) entered live birth observation  data into a mobile App from 320 PHCs. METHODS: The NMMs completed prompted questions  in the App after every live birth witnessed. The App consisted of questions around  three main themes, "What went well?", "What needed improvement?" and "What can be  done differently next time?". RESULTS: Observational data from 5,799 births was  recorded by 120 NMMs in 320 PHCs. Knowledge and skill during normal spontaneous  vaginal deliveries and complicated deliveries with either a postpartum haemorrhage  or non-vigorous infant all showed statistically significant improvement (p < .001)  over time using a Chi-squared test for trend with a mean increase of 41% across all  indicators.

AB  - Assessment of Peyronie's disease with penile injection is invasive and  uncomfortable. We developed a smartphone application (UWPEN) to assess penile  angulation in the home environment. The purpose of this study was to compare  clinician and patient measurements and assess the patient experience with UWPEN in a  clinical setting. We prospectively enrolled patients with Peyronie's disease  undergoing intracavernosal injection of alprostadil. Penile angulation and narrowing  were then assessed by patients and clinicians using UWPEN and compared to values  obtained via a goniometer and a ruler (gold standard). Measurements were compared  using the Pearson correlation test. Upon completion of measurements, patients were  surveyed regarding the ease of use, confidence with use, and measurement  preferences. Twenty patients were enrolled in the study; two patients were excluded  for poor penile turgidity after a maximum dosage of intracavernosal alprostadil.  Correlation between UWPEN and gold standard measurements by patients and clinicians  was R = 0.55 (p = 0.01) and R = 0.87 (p < 0.01) for dorsal measurements, R = 0.62  (p = 0.01) and R = 0.77 (p < 0.01) for lateral measurements, and R = 0.73 (p < 0.01)  and R = 0.64 (p < 0.01) for girth measurements, respectively. Prior evaluation of  correlation suggests a strong correlation at R = 0.8, and good correlation at  R = 0.5. Overall, patients preferred using UWPEN to traditional measurements, and  75% reported UWPEN as their first preference for measurements. UWPEN enables  patients to assess their disease severity with good correlation to gold standard  measurements. Patients prefer mobile platforms for disease monitoring, and  development of technology for disease monitoring should be a priority within the  Peyronie's disease research community.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The System for Improving and Measuring Procedural Learning (SIMPL) is a  smart-phone application used to provide residents with an evaluation of operative  autonomy and feedback. This study investigated the perceived benefits and barriers  to app use. DESIGN: A database of previously performed SIMPL evaluations was  analyzed to identify high, low, and never users. Potential predisposing factors to  use were explored. A survey investigating key areas of value and barriers to use for  the SIMPL application was sent to resident and faculty users. Respondents were asked  to self-identify how often they used the app. The perceived benefits and barriers  were correlated with the level of usage. Qualitative analysis of free text responses  was used to determine strategies to increase usage. SETTING: General surgery  training programs who are members of the Procedural Learning and Safety  Collaborative. PARTICIPANTS: Surgical residents and faculty. RESULTS: At least 1  SIMPL evaluation was created for 411 residents and 524 faculty. Thirty percent of  both faculty and residents were high-frequency users. Thirty percent of faculty were  never users. One hundred eighty-eight residents and 207 faculty (response rate 46%)  completed the survey. High-frequency resident users were more likely to perceive a  benefit for both numerical evaluations (76% vs 30%) and dictated feedback (92% vs  30%). Faculty and residents commonly blamed each other for not creating and  completing evaluations regularly (87% of residents, 81% of faculty). Suggested  strategies to increase usage included reminders and integration with existing data  systems. CONTRIBUTIONS: Frequent users perceive value from the application,  particularly from dictated feedback and see a positive impact on feedback in their  programs. Faculty engagement represents a major barrier to adoption. Mechanisms  which automatically remind residents to initiate an evaluation will help improve  utilization but programs must work to enhance faculty willingness to respond and  dictate feedback.

TI  - Is Online Treatment as Effective as In-Person Treatment?: Psychological Change in  Two Relationship Skills Groups.
AU  - Church, Dawson
AU  - Clond, Morgan
T2  - The Journal of nervous and mental disease
AB  - Psychotherapy has undergone a widespread change recently, with many interventions  now available as wireless device apps or online courses. The current study compared  the efficacy of an online program with a personal group treatment intervention. The  in-person group (n = 37) attended a 6-day workshop called Tapping Deep Intimacy that  focused on the development of interpersonal skills. The online group (n = 37)  consumed to the same information in the form of a 12-week online course. The content  of both courses was drawn from the curriculum for Whole Energy Lifestyle, which  trains participants in 12 evidence-based interpersonal and stress-reduction skills  designed to reduce emotional triggering and promote health. These include  mindfulness, breathwork, meditation (EcoMeditation), heart coherence, Clinical  Emotional Freedom Techniques, active listening, and qigong. In both groups,  depression, anxiety, and relationship satisfaction were assessed pre, post, and at  1-year follow-up. Anxiety reduced in the in-person but not the online group.  Significant improvements in depression (p < 0.001) were found in both groups,  although sharper symptom declines were found in the in-person group. A 29%  improvement in relationship satisfaction was found in both groups (p < 0.003), and  both maintained their gains over time. Anxiety and depression symptoms were much  higher in the in-person group pretest despite similar demographic characteristics,  suggesting differences in the population that uses online courses. These preliminary  findings suggest that while online programs may play a role in the development of  stress-reduction and interpersonal skills, it cannot be assumed that they mirror the  therapeutic efficacy of in-person treatment in every dimension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Concurrent validity and intra-rater reliability using a customized  Android phone application to measure cervical-spine range-of-motion (ROM) has not  been previously validated against a gold-standard three-dimensional motion analysis  (3DMA) system. FINDINGS: Twenty-one healthy individuals (age:31 ± 9.1 years,  male:11) participated, with 16 re-examined for intra-rater reliability 1-7 days  later. An Android phone was fixed on a helmet, which was then securely fastened on  the participant's head. Cervical-spine ROM in flexion, extension, lateral flexion  and rotation were performed in sitting with concurrent measurements obtained from  both a 3DMA system and the phone.The phone demonstrated moderate to excellent  (ICC = 0.53-0.98, Spearman ρ = 0.52-0.98) concurrent validity for ROM measurements  in cervical flexion, extension, lateral-flexion and rotation. However, cervical  rotation demonstrated both proportional and fixed bias. Excellent intra-rater  reliability was demonstrated for cervical flexion, extension and lateral flexion  (ICC = 0.82-0.90), but poor for right- and left-rotation (ICC = 0.05-0.33) using the  phone. Possible reasons for the outcome are that flexion, extension and  lateral-flexion measurements are detected by gravity-dependent accelerometers while  rotation measurements are detected by the magnetometer which can be adversely  affected by surrounding magnetic fields. CONCLUSION: The results of this study  demonstrate that the tested Android phone application is valid and reliable to  measure ROM of the cervical-spine in flexion, extension and lateral-flexion but not  in rotation likely due to magnetic interference. The clinical implication of this  study is that therapists should be mindful of the plane of measurement when using  the Android phone to measure ROM of the cervical-spine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in low-resource  settings demands innovative public health approaches. OBJECTIVES: To design and test  a novel mHealth tool for use by community health workers (CHWs) to identify  individuals at high CVD risk who would benefit from education and/or pharmacologic  interventions. METHODS: We designed and implemented a novel two-way mobile phone  application, "AFYACHAT," to rapidly screen for CVD risk in rural Kenya. AFYACHAT  collects and stores SMS text message data entered by a CHW on a subject's age, sex,  smoking, diabetes, and systolic blood pressure, and returns as SMS text message the  category of 10-year CVD risk: "GREEN" (<10% 10 year risk of cardiovascular event),  "YELLOW" (10 to <20%), "orange"(20 to <30%), or "RED" (≥30%). CHWs were equipped and  trained to use an automated blood pressure device and the mHealth tool. RESULTS:  Five CHWs screened 2,865 subjects in remote rural communities in Kenya over a 22  month period (2015-17). The median age of subjects was 50 (IQR 43 to 60) and 1581  (55%) were female. Point prevalence of hypertension (systolic blood  pressure>140mmHg), diabetes, and tobacco use were 23%, 3.2%, and 22%, respectively.  Overall, the 10-year risk of CVD among patients was <10% in 2778 (97%) patients, 10  to <20% in 65 (2.3%), 20 to <30% in 12 (0.4%), and ≥30% in 10 (0.2%). CONCLUSION: We  have developed a mHealth tool that can be used by CHWs to screen for CVD risk  factors, demonstrating proof-of-concept in rural Kenya.

T2  - Journal of cataract and refractive surgery
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the error in intraocular lens (IOL) toric alignment of 2 toric  markers. SETTING: Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia,  Australia. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Two consecutive groups of  patients had cataract surgery with implantation of an AcrySof SN6A toric IOL  (versions T2-T8) by the same surgeon at 2 public hospitals. The only difference in  the toric alignment method between the groups was the toric maker used (Group 1:  Barrett dual axis toric marker; Group 2: Mendez gauge). A mobile phone application  (toriCAM) was used in both groups to determine the reference meridian. The primary  outcome measure was the error in toric IOL alignment in degrees at 1 month. The  secondary outcome measure was the percentage of eyes achieving a manifest refraction  astigmatism within ±0.50 diopter (D) at 1 month. RESULTS: Seventy-two eyes of 56  patients were included (Group 1: 36 eyes of 35 patients; Group 2: 36 eyes of 25  patients). The mean absolute toric alignment error (intended versus achieved axis of  alignment) was 4.0 degrees ± 2.9 (SD) in Group 1 and 8.4 ± 6.5 degrees in Group 2  (P = .0015). Twenty-nine eyes (80.6%) in Group 1 and 21 eyes (53.8%) in Group 2  achieved a manifest refractive astigmatism of 0.50 D or less (P < .05). CONCLUSION:  Toric IOL alignment using the mobile phone application was more accurate with the  Barrett dual axis toric marker than with the commonly used Mendez gauge, with a  significantly higher percentage of eyes achieving a manifest refraction astigmatism  within ±0.50 D.

AB  - Acute pesticide intoxication is a common method of suicide globally. This article  reviews current diagnostic methods and makes suggestions for future development. In  the case of paraquat intoxication, it is characterized by multi-organ failure,  causing substantial mortality and morbidity. Early diagnosis may save the life of a  paraquat intoxication patient. Conventional paraquat intoxication diagnostic  methods, such as symptom review and urine sodium dithionite assay, are  time-consuming and impractical in resource-scarce areas where most intoxication  cases occur. Several experimental and clinical studies have shown the potential of  portable Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS), paper-based devices, and machine  learning for paraquat intoxication diagnosis. Portable SERS and new SERS substrates  maintain the sensitivity of SERS while being less costly and more convenient than  conventional SERS. Paper-based devices provide the advantages of price and  portability. Machine learning algorithms can be implemented as a mobile phone  application and facilitate diagnosis in resource-limited areas. Although these  methods have not yet met all features of an ideal diagnostic method, the combination  and development of these methods offer much promise.

T2  - Journal of clinical monitoring and computing
AB  - Quantitative neuromuscular block (NMB) assessment is an internationally recognised  necessity in anesthesia care whenever neuromuscular blocking agents are  administered. Despite this, the incidence of residual neuromuscular block and its  associated major respiratory morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high  considering its preventable nature. Recent surveys show that quantitative NMB  assessment is not consistently employed by anesthesiologists. Availability, price  and practical concerns are some of the factors determining this phenomenon.  Clinically assess and validate an Android cell phone application conceived  specifically for NMB Monitoring in the anesthesia setting. Twenty-two adult ASA I to  III patients scheduled to undergo elective surgical procedures under general  anaesthesia requiring administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent were  included. After anaesthesia induction, the grade of neuromuscular block was assessed  at multiple independent time-points by paired comparison of the train of four (TOF)  Ratios obtained by a Stimpod™ accelerometer and the currently developed application.  Accelerometric measurements were made at the patient's hand after retrograde  supramaximal stimulation of the ipsilateral ulnar nerve. TOF-ratios were subjected  to bias analysis with 0.001 as the a priori established clinical significance  cut-off. The difference between the two methods averaged 0.0004 (95% limits of  agreement: ± 0.12), with 83.3% of the differences being under 0.05. This average  inter-method difference was not significantly different than the a priori  hypothesized difference cut-off of 0.001 (p = 0.78). Lin's concordance correlation  coefficient and Pearson's correlation were both of 0.98. The custom developed  Android application proved accurate for diagnosis of residual neuromuscular block.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in adults,  associated with significant morbidity, increased mortality, and rising health-care  costs. Simple and available tools for the accurate detection of arrhythmia  recurrence in patients after electrical cardioversion (CV) or ablation procedures  for AF can help to guide therapeutic decisions. We conducted a prospective,  single-center study to evaluate the accuracy of Cardiio Rhythm Mobile Application  (CRMA) for AF detection. Patients >18 years of age who were scheduled for elective  CV for AF were enrolled in the study. CRMA finger pulse recordings, utilizing an  iPhone camera, were obtained before (pre-CV) and after (post-CV) the CV. The  findings were validated against surface electrocardiograms. Ninety-eight patients  (75.5% men), mean age of 67.7 ± 10.5 years, were enrolled. No electrocardiogram for  validation was available in 1 case. Pre-CV CRMA readings were analyzed in 97 of the  98 patients. Post-CV CRMA readings were analyzed for 92 of 93 patients who underwent  CV. One patient left before the recording was obtained. The Cardiio Rhythm Mobile  Application correctly identified 94 of 101 AF recordings (93.1%) as AF and 80 of 88  non-AF recordings (90.1%) as non-AF. The sensitivity was 93.1% (95% confidence  interval [CI] = 86.9% to 97.2%) and the specificity was 90.9% (95% CI = 82.9% to  96.0%). The positive predictive value was 92.2% (95% CI = 85.8% to 95.8%) and the  negative predictive value was 92.0% (95% CI = 94.8% to 95.9%). In conclusion, the  CRMA demonstrates promising potential in accurate detection and discrimination of AF  from normal sinus rhythm in patients with a history of AF.

AB  - Background: Women with breast cancer (BC) commonly experience physical and  psychosocial symptoms after surgery. Web- and smartphone-based support can  significantly improve women's symptoms and quality of life. Social care applications  (apps) are widely used in China, but there are few studies on their effectiveness BC  support. This study aimed to examine the effects of nurse-led support on the social  care app WeChat(®) (Tencent Holdings Limited, Shenzhen, China) in BC patients after  surgery. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted between June 2015 and  August 2015. Sixty patients with BC (30 in the intervention group, 30 in the control  group) were enrolled. Subjects in the intervention group participated in a  WeChat-based support program (WSP) led by nurses, while subjects in the control  group received a follow-up by telephone. Subjects in both groups were evaluated at  the time of discharge and at 1, 3, and 6 months of follow-up. Physical well-being  status, psychology status, and social support were evaluated. Results: There were no  differences between intervention and control patients at baseline. Physical  well-being (p < 0.001), anxiety (p < 0.001), depression (p < 0.001), and support  from outside of family (p  = 0.037) were significantly better in the intervention  group than in the control group after 6 months. The intervention group showed that  physical well-being (p  = 0.036), anxiety (p < 0.001), and depression (p < 0.001)  were significantly different from baseline to 6 months of follow-up. Conclusion: WSP  assisted with nurse-led support and had physical, psychological, and social benefits  for patients after surgery for BC.

AB  - The addition of smartphone applications to the armamentarium of tools to help manage  patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has the potential to improve care in  multiple ways, including enhanced disease understanding, improved adherence to  medications, accessible support networks, and earlier interventions by medical  professionals when problems arise. However, at present, for patients with IBD, the  development of such mobile applications is still in its infancy. We conducted a  review of the literature and online resources including phone application stores  (Apple and Android app stores) to assess the current availability of mobile health  applications for IBD patients and opportunities to increase patient engagement. We  also addressed the limitations and challenges of patient and provider adoption of  mobile-based technologies for IBD self-management and remote monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of mobile technology such as phone applications (apps) has been  proposed as an efficient means of providing health and clinical information in a  variety of healthcare settings. We developed the Health-e Babies app as an Android  smart phone application for pregnant women attending a tertiary hospital in a low  socio-economic community, with the objective of providing health information about  early pregnancy that would increase maternal confidence and reduce anxiety. Based on  our earlier research, this form of health communication was viewed as a preferred  source of information for women of reproductive age. However, the pilot study had a  poor participation rate with 76% (n = 94) not completing the study requirements.  These initial findings raised some very important issues in relation to the  difficulties of engaging women with a pregnancy app. This paper analyses the  characteristics of the participants who did not complete the study requirements in  an attempt to identify potential barriers associated with the implementation of a  pregnancy app. METHODS: This retrospective review of quantitative and qualitative  data collected at the commencement of the Health-e Babies App trial, related to the  participant's communication technology use, confidence in knowing where to seek help  and mental health status, maternal-fetal attachment and parenting confidence.  Engagement and use of the Health-e Babies App was measured by the completion of a  questionnaire about the app and downloaded data from participant's phones. Mental  health status, confidence and self-efficacy were measured by questionnaires.  RESULTS: All women were similar in terms of age, race, marital status and level of  education. Of the 94 women (76%) who did not complete the trial, they were  significantly more anxious as indicated by State Trait Anxiety Inventory (p = 0.001  Student T-test) and more likely to be unemployed (50% vs 31%, p = 0.012 Student  T-Test). CONCLUSION: This study provides important information about the challenges  associated with the implementation of a pregnancy app in a socially disadvantaged  community. The data suggests that factors including social and mental health issues,  financial constraints and technological ability can affect women's engagement with a  mobile phone app.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New technologies have recently been used for monitoring signs and  symptoms of mental health illnesses and particularly have been tested to improve the  outcomes in bipolar disorders. Web-based psychoeducational programs for bipolar  disorders have also been implemented, yet to our knowledge, none of them have  integrated both approaches in one single intervention. The aim of this project is to  develop and validate a smartphone application to monitor symptoms and signs and  empower the self-management of bipolar disorder, offering customized embedded  psychoeducation contents, in order to identify early symptoms and prevent relapses  and hospitalizations. METHODS/DESIGN: The project will be carried out in three  complementary phases, which will include a feasibility study (first phase), a  qualitative study (second phase) and a randomized controlled trial (third phase)  comparing the smartphone application (SIMPLe) on top of treatment as usual with  treatment as usual alone. During the first phase, feasibility and satisfaction will  be assessed with the application usage log data and with an electronic survey. Focus  groups will be conducted and technical improvements will be incorporated at the  second phase. Finally, at the third phase, survival analysis with multivariate data  analysis will be performed and relationships between socio-demographic, clinical  variables and assessments scores with relapses in each group will be explored.  DISCUSSION: This project could result in a highly available, user-friendly and not  costly monitoring and psychoeducational intervention that could improve the outcome  of people suffering from bipolar disorders in a practical and secure way.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Meditation has become increasingly popular due to its health benefits;  however, barriers to delivering meditation programs in traditional group-based  formats limit the accessibility of these benefits. Smartphone-based meditation may  increase the availability of these programs to larger, more diverse audiences;  however, research on subscriber characteristics and usage patterns in meditation  mobile apps is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the demographics,  clinical characteristics, and usage patterns of a convenience sample of Calm  subscribers and explore the relationship between self-reported app usage and changes  in health, stress, and sleep. METHODS: Participants were 12,151 paying Calm  subscribers (response rate=12.08%, 12,151/100,594) who completed an anonymous  Web-based survey with 11 quantitative questions related to user engagement, reasons  for starting Calm, and changes after using the app. Demographic characteristics,  chronic health diagnoses, and sleep difficulties were also assessed. Chi-square  tests were used to examine differences in app usage. Logistic regression models were  used to examine demographic and health characteristics that may predict changes in  health, stress, and sleep. RESULTS: Respondents were 18-96 years old (mean 48.57 [SD  13.79]), primarily female (79.94%, 8778/10,981), white (81.41%, 8959/11,005), and  most reported a chronic health diagnosis (56.86%, 6289/11,061). Mental health  diagnoses (41.13%, 4549/11,061) were more common than physical health diagnoses  (32.19%, 3560/11,061). Most respondents (76.31%, 8684/11,360) reported difficulties  falling or staying asleep. On average, respondents had been using Calm for 11.49  months (SD 10.49), and 60.03% (7281/12,129) used it 5 or more times per week.  Meditations (used by 80.02%, 9497/11,841) and Sleep Stories (55.66%, 6591/11,841)  were the most popular components. The frequency of using Calm was associated with  incremental increases in the likelihood of noticing changes in mental health  (χ(2)(2)=136.8; P<.001), physical health (χ(2)(2)=102.8; P<.001), stress  (χ(2)(2)=128.1; P<.001), and sleep (χ(2)(2)=141.4; P<.001). Respondents who had used  Calm longer were also more likely to notice changes in mental health (OR 1.06 [95%  CI 1.05 to 1.06]), physical health (OR 1.01 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.02]), stress (OR 1.04  [95% CI 1.04 to 1.05]), and sleep (OR 1.004 [95% CI 1.00 to 1.01]). Subscribers with  sleep difficulties used Calm more frequently (χ(8)(2)=11.5; P=.003), were more  likely to use Sleep Stories (χ(1)(2)=1590.2; P<.001), and were more likely to notice  changes in their physical health (χ(1)(2)=49.2; P<.001) and sleep (χ(1)(2)=2391.1;  P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight important demographic characteristics and  usage patterns among a self-selected sample of Calm subscribers. Mental health  concerns and sleep appear to be top reasons for downloading Calm. Sleep Stories and  meditations are the most popular app components. The frequency of using Calm was  associated with incremental changes in outcomes. Findings support future randomized  controlled trials testing the efficacy of Calm for health, stress, and sleep.  Studies should also explore strategies to attract a more diverse sample of  subscribers.

AB  - Objective Suicide prevention is a high priority. Scalable and sustainable  interventions for suicide prevention are needed to set the stage for  population-level impact. This systematic review explores how technology-enhanced  interventions target suicide risk and protective factors, using the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2015) Risk and Protective Factors Ecological  Model. Methods Information databases (PsycINFO, PubMed and CINAHL) were  systematically searched and records including technology-enhanced interventions for  suicide prevention ( n = 3764) were reviewed. Records with varying technologies and  diverse methodologies were integrated into the search. Results Review of the records  resulted in the inclusion of 16 studies that utilized technology-enhanced  interventions to address determinants of suicidal behaviour. This includes the use  of standalone or, in most cases, adjunct technology-enhanced interventions for  suicide prevention delivered by mobile phone application, text message, telephone,  computer, web, CD-ROM and video. Conclusion Intervention effectiveness was variable,  but several technology-enhanced interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in  reducing suicidal ideation and mental health co-morbidities. Large-scale research  and evaluation initiatives are needed to evaluate the costs and long-term  population-level impact of these interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the availability of  scientific data, where human-related biological databases have grown not only in  count but also in volume, posing unprecedented challenges in data storage,  processing, analysis, exchange, and curation. Next generation sequencing (NGS)  advancements have facilitated and accelerated the process of identifying genetic  variations. Adopting NGS with Whole-Genome and RNA sequencing in a diagnostic  context has the potential to improve disease-risk detection in support of precision  medicine and drug discovery. Several bioinformatics pipelines have been developed to  strengthen variant interpretation by efficiently processing and analyzing sequence  data, whereas many published results show how genomics data can be proactively  incorporated into medical practices and improve utilization of clinical information.  To utilize the wealth of genomics and health, there is a crucial need to generate  appropriate gene-disease annotation repositories accessed through modern technology.  RESULTS: Our focus here is to create a comprehensive database with mobile access to  actionable genes and classified diseases, considered the foundation for clinical  genomics and precision medicine. We present a publicly available iOS app, PAS-Gen,  which invites global users to freely download it on iPhone and iPad devices, quickly  adopt its easy to use interface, and search for genes and related diseases. PAS-Gen  was developed using Swift, XCODE, and PHP scripting that uses Web and MySQL database  servers, which includes over 59,000 protein-coding and non-coding genes, and over  90,000 classified gene-disease associations. PAS-Gen is founded on the clinical and  scientific premise that easier healthcare and genomics data sharing will accelerate  future medical discoveries. CONCLUSIONS: We present a cutting-edge gene-disease  database with a smart phone application, integrating information on classified  diseases and related genes. The PAS-Gen app will assist researchers, medical  practitioners, and pharmacists by providing a broad and view of genes that may be  implicated in the likelihood of developing certain diseases. This tool with  accelerate users' abilities to understand the genetic basis of human complex  diseases and by assimilating genomic and phenotypic data will support future work to  identify gene-specific designer drugs, target precise molecular fingerprints for  tumors, suggest appropriate drug therapies, predict individual susceptibility to  disease, and diagnose and treat rare illnesses.

AB  - Despite major advancements in mechanical circulatory support, the self-management  (SM) for patients with a left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) remains complex and  challenging for patients and their caregivers. We have developed a mobile phone  application (VAD Care App) to organize and simplify the LVAD SM process. This  article describes the development and feasibility study of the app as an SM tool for  LVAD patients and caregivers requiring support from ventricular assist device (VAD)  coordinators. The specific aim was to evaluate the app's acceptability and usability  and the users' competency. App features included an automated alert, data  collection/reporting, and dynamic real-time interaction systems embedded in the LVAD  SM process. Beta-testing of the prototype was completed by five adults. For the  feasibility study, we employed a mixed-method descriptive research design involving  nine patients and nine caregivers from two VAD centers in the Midwest. We asked them  to use the app daily for more than 30 days and complete an app Evaluation  Questionnaire and an interview. The questionnaire uses a five-point rating scale (1  = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) evaluating usability, acceptability, and  competency domains. Data generated from the questionnaires and interviews were  analyzed with descriptive statistics and content analytic procedures. A total of 16  users (eight patients [all male] and eight caregivers [seven female]) aged 22 to 68  years completed the 30 day study. Median acceptability, usability, and competency  scores were 4.6, 4.5, and 4.7, respectively. Based on the data, it is feasible for  patients and caregivers to use an app as an LVAD SM tool warranting further  research.

AB  - Background: With the increasing availability of Smartphones and wearable tracking  devices, it is now feasible and affordable to apply such mobile devices to  delivering mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and intermittent fasting (IF)  to lower blood pressure, as traditional MBSR and IF incur the burden of commuting to  the intervention sites for the patients. Our study will develop and scientifically  evaluate an MBSR app, an IF app and an MBSR + IF app in terms of their effectiveness  for lowering blood pressure. We will further explore the possible interaction effect  (synergistic effect) between MBSR and IF intervention: will improved mindfulness  enhance patients' adherence to the IF protocol? Methods: We will develop an MBSR  app, an IF app, and an MBSR+IF app. We will then conduct an 8-week randomized  controlled trial with a factorial design to evaluate the efficacy of these new apps,  especially the interaction effect between MBSR and IF. Eligible individuals will be  randomly assigned to Group 1 (MBSR app), Group 2 (IF app), Group 3 (MBSR + IF app)  or Group 4 (usual care). Discussion: This will be the first attempt to explore the  impact of mindfulness intervention on the adherence of a behavioral intervention.  Nevertheless, our protocol is limited in that the effectiveness of intermittent  fasting on lowering blood pressure has not been supported by large-sample randomized  controlled trials. Thus if there is no significant effectiveness we cannot determine  whether it is due to the intermittent fasting intervention itself or it is due to  the limit of smartphone as a vehicle.

AB  - Teledermatology generally involves doctors taking images of patients; however,  patients increasingly want to own or have easy access to their health data.  MySkinSelfie ( http://myskinselfie.com) is a mobile phone application (app) designed  to improve the quality, consistency and accessibility of patient-held photos, and  was developed to give patients the ability to generate and hold their own skin  images to help guide their skin care. This study assessed the usability of this app  in a cohort of patients attending a National Health Service Dermatology clinic.  Patients were asked to use the app but were not given specific tasks to achieve. Of  the 102 patients recruited, 32 downloaded the app and registered an account, 21 took  at least one photo (median 5, range 1-103) and 19 completed the usability  questionnaire. The majority of questionnaire respondents found the app easy to use  but were more neutral on whether it really helped them to manage their skin problem.  MySkinSelfie has been shown to be easy to use. Self-monitoring of skin problems may  be useful for a subset of patients, and this is likely to depend on diagnosis, age  and other patient factors.

AB  - AIM: It is important that nurses possess adequate clinical skills so that the  patient receives safe and competent care. Smart phone applications (apps) can  promote active learning and the long-term retention of knowledge of undergraduate  students. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the thoughts and  experiences of nursing students who received a smart phone, app-based physical  assessment educational intervention. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive approach  with in-depth interviews was considered as suitable to obtain a comprehensive  understanding of students' experiences of a smart phone-enabled physical assessment  course. RESULTS: Based on interviews with 16 nursing students following the  intervention, five themes were derived from the analysis of the interview  transcripts: "the APP's physical assessment scenarios are very close to real-life  clinical situations," "watching physical assessment videos over the APP is a quick  way to learn what to do," "the APP is a new way of learning that enhances thinking  and reflection," "some nursing students felt that it was out of their depth to  analyze the scenarios in the APP," and "the APP needs enhancements in stability and  interactivity." CONCLUSION: The findings of this study showed the mobile app as an  effective learning aid that promoted transferability of the nursing students'  knowledge and past experience. With the help of the APP, the teachers could offer  timely guidance to the students.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral intervention is a key approach to HIV prevention among men  who have sex with men (MSM). Widespread use of mobile phones provide us with novel  opportunities to decrease HIV infection and transmission of MSM. The objective of  the study was to design and develop a mobile phone application (app) aims to conduct  behavioral intervention to MSM and to evaluate the efficacy of the app-based  intervention compared to usual care, to analyze cost-effectiveness and mechanism of  the intervention. METHODS: This study involves 2 phases, phase 1 use qualitative  method and phase 2 is a randomized controlled trial lasting for 18 months, they will  be conducted in Chagnsha, Hunan Province, China. Phase 1 is to design and develop  the app, procedures including retrieval of domestic apps related to prevention and  treatment about HIV and sexually transmitted diseases (HIV/STDs), personal  interviews with MSM about preferences and functional needs of the HIV prevention  app, multidisciplinary experts focused group discussions of the app, software  engineers' development and users test of the app will be performed. In phase 2, we  will recruit 800 MSM by cooperating with the local center of disease control and  prevention and nongovernmental organizations, and divide them into intervention and  control group evenly. Intervention group participants will receive app-based HIV  prevention. Control group participants will be provided with usual care including  HIV/STDs knowledge brochure and free voluntary counseling services. Data will be  collected at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months since subject's participation.  Effectiveness of the intervention includes HIV/STDs infection rates, adherence to  regularly HIV testing, sexual risk behavior, consistent condom use and relative risk  of HIV infection. Cost-effectiveness will be analyzed by decision-analytic modeling,  and mechanism analysis of this app-based intervention will be performed by path  analysis. DISCUSSION: This will be the first study of its kind in China to develop  an app and implement app-based HIV prevention intervention among MSM. It is of great  potential to determine whether app-based intervention is a cost-effective way to  decrease HIV infection among MSM and explore intervention mechanism with an accurate  method.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Stress and unusual events are associated with a higher likelihood of  attacks and increased symptom severity in Menière's disease (MD). BACKGROUND: MD is  an unpredictable condition which severely impacts the quality of life of those  affected. It is thought that unusual activity and stress may act as an attack  trigger in MD, but research in this area has been limited to date. METHODS: This was  a longitudinal study conducted over two phases. A mobile phone application was used  to collect daily data on Menière's attacks and individual symptoms (aural fullness,  dizziness, hearing loss, and tinnitus), as well as prevalence of unusual events  (phase I), and stress levels (phase II). There were 1,031 participants (730 women,  mean age 46.0 yr) in phase I and 695 participants (484 women, mean age 47.7 yr) in  phase II. Panel data regression analyses were employed to examine for associations  between unusual events/stress and attacks/symptoms, including the study of 24 hours  lead and lag effects. RESULTS: Unusual events and higher stress levels were  associated with higher odds of Menière's attacks and more severe symptoms. The odds  of experiencing an attack were 2.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.37, 3.65) with  reporting of unusual events and increased by 1.24 (95% CI 1.20, 1.28) per unit  increase in stress level. Twenty-four hour lead (OR 1.10 [95% CI 1.07, 1.14]) and  lag (OR 1.10 [95% CI 1.06, 1.13]) effects on attacks were also found with increases  in stress. CONCLUSION: This study provides the strongest evidence to date that  stress and unusual events are associated with attacks and symptom exacerbation in  MD. Improving our understanding of stress and unusual events as triggers in  Menière's may reduce the uncertainty associated with this condition and lead to  improved quality of life for affected individuals.

The intervention is aimed at increasing positive mental health and  decreasing caregiver's burden. METHODS/DESIGN: Randomized and controlled trial with  an experimental group and a control group. SUBJECTS: 108 caregivers over 18, with a  minimum of 4 months of experience as caregivers. Description of the intervention: an  intervention with a smartphone app (n = 54) or a regular intervention for caregivers  (n = 54). Each caregiver installs a smartphone app and uses it for 28 days. This app  offers them a daily activity (Monday-Friday). These activities are related to the  Decalogue of Positive Mental Health, which was designed ad hoc by a group of  experts. The outcomes will be the score of caregiver burden, the positive mental  health and participant satisfaction. These results will be assessed after the first,  third and sixth month. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will offer evidence of  the effectiveness of an intervention using a free smartphone app. If its  effectiveness is proven and the results are acceptable, this could lead to a  rethinking of the intervention offered to caregivers in primary care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphone-based sensors may enable real-time surveillance of infectious  diseases at population and household levels. This study evaluates the use of data  from commercially available "smart thermometers," connected to a mobile phone  application, for surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). METHODS: At a  population level, we analyzed the correlation between thermometer recordings and  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-reported ILI activity nationally and by  age group and region. We developed time-series models to forecast ILI activity in  real time and up to 3 weeks in advance. We analyzed the ability of thermometer  readings to track the duration of fevers and identify biphasic fever patterns. We  also investigated potential transmission of febrile illness within households among  device users. RESULTS: Thermometer readings were highly correlated with national ILI  activity (r > 0.95) and activity patterns across regions and age groups. Thermometer  readings also significantly improved forecasts of ILI activity in real time and up  to 3 weeks in advance. We found that fevers lasting between 3 and 6 days and  biphasic fever episodes occurred more frequently during the influenza season. In  addition, potential cases of in-household transmission of febrile illness originated  more frequently from children than adults. CONCLUSIONS: Smart thermometers represent  a novel source of information for influenza surveillance and forecasting.  Thermometer readings capture real-time ILI activity at a population level, and they  can also be used to generate improved forecasts. Moreover, the widespread deployment  of these smart thermometers may also allow for more rapid and efficient surveillance  at the household level.

T2  - Crisis
AB  - BACKGROUND: Safety plans have been suggested as an intervention for people at risk  of suicide. Given the impulsive character of suicidal ideation, a safety plan in the  format of a mobile phone application is likely to be more available and useful than  traditional paper versions. AIMS: The study describes MYPLAN, a mobile phone  application designed to support people at risk of suicide by letting them create a  safety plan. METHOD: MYPLAN was developed in collaboration with clinical psychiatric  staff at Danish suicide preventive clinics. The mobile application lets the user  create an individualized safety plan by filling in templates with strategies,  actions, and direct links to contact persons. RESULTS: MYPLAN was developed in 2013  and is freely available in Denmark and Norway. It is designed for iPhone and android  platforms. As of December 2015, the application has been downloaded almost 8,000  times. Users at risk of suicide as well as clinical staff have provided positive  feedback on the mobile application. CONCLUSION: Support via mobile phone  applications might be particularly useful for younger age groups at risk of suicide  as well as in areas or countries where support options are lacking. Yet, it is  important to examine the effectiveness of this type of intervention.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The holistic management of hearing loss (HL) requires an understanding  of factors that predict hearing aid (HA) use and benefit beyond the acoustics of  listening environments. Although several predictors have been identified, no study  has explored the role of audiological, cognitive, behavioural and physiological data  nor has any study collected real-time HA data. This study will collect 'big data',  including retrospective HA logging data, prospective clinical data and real-time  data via smart HAs, a mobile application and biosensors. The main objective is to  enable the validation of the EVOTION platform as a public health policy-making tool  for HL. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a big data international multicentre  study consisting of retrospective and prospective data collection. Existing data  from approximately 35 000 HA users will be extracted from clinical repositories in  the UK and Denmark. For the prospective data collection, 1260 HA candidates will be  recruited across four clinics in the UK and Greece. Participants will complete a  battery of audiological and other assessments (measures of patient-reported HA  benefit, mood, cognition, quality of life). Patients will be offered smart HAs and a  mobile phone application and a subset will also be given wearable biosensors, to  enable the collection of dynamic real-life HA usage data. Big data analytics will be  used to detect correlations between contextualised HA usage and effectiveness, and  different factors and comorbidities affecting HL, with a view to informing public  health decision-making. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was received from  the London South East Research Ethics Committee (17/LO/0789), the Hippokrateion  Hospital Ethics Committee (1847) and the Athens Medical Center's Ethics Committee  (KM140670). Results will be disseminated through national and international events  in Greece and the UK, scientific journals, newsletters, magazines and social media.  Target audiences include HA users, clinicians, policy-makers and the general public.  TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03316287; Pre-results.

AB  - We examined the association between meteorological (weather) conditions in a given  locale and pedestrian trips frequency and duration, through the use of locative  digital data. These associations were determined for seasonality, urban  microclimate, and commuting. We analyzed GPS data from a broadly available activity  tracking mobile phone application that automatically recorded 247,814 trips from  5432 unique users in Boston and 257,697 trips from 8256 users in San Francisco over  a 50-week period. Generally, we observed increased air temperature and the presence  of light cloud cover had a positive association with hourly trip frequency in both  cities, regardless of seasonality. Temperature and weather conditions generally  showed greater associations with weekend and discretionary travel, than with weekday  and required travel. Weather conditions had minimal association with the duration of  the trip, once the trip was initiated. The observed associations in some cases  differed between the two cities. Our study illustrates the opportunity that emerging  technology presents to study active transportation, and exposes new methods to wider  consideration in preventive medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients often report high symptom  burden that persists despite the best available pharmacologic therapy. Meditation  has gained popularity in recent decades as a way to manage cancer patient symptoms.  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of 2 different  consumer-based meditation smartphone apps in MPN patients and to examine the limited  efficacy of smartphone-based meditation on symptoms compared with an educational  control group. METHODS: Patients (n=128) were recruited nationally through  organizational partners and social media. Eligible and consented patients were  enrolled into 1 of 4 groups, 2 of which received varying orders of 2 consumer-based  apps (10% Happier and Calm) and 2 that received one of the apps alone for the second  4 weeks of the 8-week intervention after an educational control condition.  Participants were asked to perform 10 min of meditation per day irrespective of the  app and the order in which they received the apps. Feasibility outcomes were  measured at weeks 5 and 9 with a Web-based survey. Feasibility outcomes were  acceptability, demand, and limited efficacy for depression, anxiety, pain intensity,  sleep disturbance, sexual function, quality of life, global health, and total  symptom burden. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were enrolled across all 4 groups,  with 73.4% (94/128) patients completing the intervention. Of the participants who  completed the 10% Happier app, 61% (46/76) enjoyed it, 66% (50/76) were satisfied  with the content, and 77% (59/76) would recommend to others. Of those who completed  the Calm app, 83% (56/68) enjoyed it, 84% (57/68) were satisfied with the content,  and 97% (66/68) would recommend to others. Of those who completed the educational  control, 91% (56/61) read it, 87% (53/61) enjoyed it, and 71% (43/61) learned  something. Participants who completed the 10% Happier app averaged 31 (SD 33)  min/week; patients completing the Calm app averaged 71 (SD 74) min/week. 10% Happier  app participants saw small effects on anxiety (P<.001 d=-0.43), depression (P=.02;  d=-0.38), sleep disturbance (P=.01; d=-0.40), total symptom burden (P=.13; d=-0.27),  and fatigue (P=.06; d=-0.30), and moderate effects on physical health (P<.001;  d=0.52). Calm app participants saw small effects on anxiety (P=.29; d=-0.22),  depression (P=.09; d=-0.29), sleep disturbance (P=.002; d=-0.47), physical health  (P=.005; d=0.44), total symptom burden (P=.13; d=-0.27), and fatigue (P=.13;  d=-0.27). Educational control participants (n=61) did not have effects on any  patient-reported outcome except for a moderate effect on physical health (P<.001;  d=0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Delivering meditation via the Calm app is feasible and scored  higher in terms of feasibility when compared with the 10% Happier app. The Calm app  will be used to implement a randomized controlled trial, testing the effects of  meditation on symptom burden in MPNs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advancements in knowledge of obesity aetiology and mobile phone  technology have created the opportunity to develop an electronic tool to predict an  infant's risk of childhood obesity. The study aims were to develop and validate  equations for the prediction of childhood obesity and integrate them into a mobile  phone application (App). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Anthropometry and childhood obesity  risk data were obtained for 1868 UK-born White or South Asian infants in the Born in  Bradford cohort. Logistic regression was used to develop prediction equations (at 6  ± 1.5, 9 ± 1.5 and 12 ± 1.5 months) for risk of childhood obesity (BMI at 2 years  >91(st) centile and weight gain from 0-2 years >1 centile band) incorporating sex,  birth weight, and weight gain as predictors. The discrimination accuracy of the  equations was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC); internal validity by  comparing area under the curve to those obtained in bootstrapped samples; and  external validity by applying the equations to an external sample. An App was built  to incorporate six final equations (two at each age, one of which included maternal  BMI). The equations had good discrimination (AUCs 86-91%), with the addition of  maternal BMI marginally improving prediction. The AUCs in the bootstrapped and  external validation samples were similar to those obtained in the development  sample. The App is user-friendly, requires a minimum amount of information, and  provides a risk assessment of low, medium, or high accompanied by advice and website  links to government recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Prediction equations for risk of  childhood obesity have been developed and incorporated into a novel App, thereby  providing proof of concept that childhood obesity prediction research can be  integrated with advancements in technology.

T2  - PloS one
AB  - BACKGROUND: Each year more than 10 million people worldwide are burned severely  enough to require medical attention, with clinical outcomes noticeably worse in  resource poor settings. Expert clinical advice on acute injuries can play a  determinant role and there is a need for novel approaches that allow for timely  access to advice. We developed an interactive mobile phone application that enables  transfer of both patient data and pictures of a wound from the point-of-care to a  remote burns expert who, in turn, provides advice back. METHODS AND RESULTS: The  application is an integrated clinical decision support system that includes a mobile  phone application and server software running in a cloud environment. The client  application is installed on a smartphone and structured patient data and photographs  can be captured in a protocol driven manner. The user can indicate the specific  injured body surface(s) through a touchscreen interface and an integrated calculator  estimates the total body surface area that the burn injury affects. Predefined  standardised care advice including total fluid requirement is provided immediately  by the software and the case data are relayed to a cloud server. A text message is  automatically sent to a burn expert on call who then can access the cloud server  with the smartphone app or a web browser, review the case and pictures, and respond  with both structured and personalized advice to the health care professional at the  point-of-care. CONCLUSIONS: In this article, we present the design of the smartphone  and the server application alongside the type of structured patient data collected  together with the pictures taken at point-of-care. We report on how the application  will be introduced at point-of-care and how its clinical impact will be evaluated  prior to roll out. Challenges, strengths and limitations of the system are  identified that may help materialising or hinder the expected outcome to provide a  solution for remote consultation on burns that can be integrated into routine acute  clinical care and thereby promote equity in injury emergency care, a growing public  health burden.

AB  - The field of Mobile health (mHealth), which includes mobile phone applications  (apps), is growing rapidly and has the potential to transform healthcare by  increasing its quality and efficiency. The present paper focuses particularly on  mobile technology for body weight management, including mobile phone apps for weight  loss and the available evidence on their effectiveness. Translation of behaviour  change theory into weight management strategies, including integration in mobile  technology is also discussed. Moreover, the paper presents and discusses the myPace  platform as a case in point. There is little clinical evidence on the effectiveness  of currently available mobile phone apps in enabling behaviour change and improving  health-related outcomes, including sustained body weight loss. Moreover, it is  unclear to what extent these apps have been developed in collaboration with health  professionals, such as dietitians, and the extent to which apps draw on and  operationalise behaviour change techniques has not been explored. Furthermore,  presently weight management apps are not built for use as part of dietetic practice,  or indeed healthcare more widely, where face-to-face engagement is fundamental for  instituting the building blocks for sustained lifestyle change. myPace is an  innovative mobile technology for weight management meant to be embedded into and to  enhance dietetic practice. Developed out of systematic, iterative stages of  engagement with dietitians and consumers, it is uniquely designed to complement and  support the trusted health practitioner-patient relationship. Future mHealth  technology would benefit if engagement with health professionals and/or targeted  patient groups, and behaviour change theory stood as the basis for technology  development. Particularly, integrating technology into routine health care practice,  rather than replacing one with the other, could be the way forward.

AB  - The high prevalence of skin diseases in resource-poor settings, where health workers  with sufficient knowledge of skin diseases are scarce, calls for innovative  measures. Timely diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases, especially neglected  tropical diseases (NTDs) that manifest with skin lesions, such as leprosy, is  crucial to prevent disabilities as well as psychological and socioeconomic problems.  Innovative technological methods like telemedicine and mobile health (mHealth) can  help to bridge the gap between the burden of skin diseases and the lack of capable  staff in resource-poor settings by bringing essential health services from central  level closer to peripheral levels. Netherlands Leprosy Relief (NLR) has developed a  mobile phone application called the 'SkinApp', which aims to support peripheral  health workers to recognize the early signs and symptoms of skin diseases, including  skin NTDs, and to start treatment promptly or refer for more advanced diagnostic  testing or disease management when needed. Further research is needed to determine  how greatly mHealth in general and the SkinApp in particular can contribute to  improved health outcomes, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Unintentional injuries are a leading cause of preventable death and a  major cause of ill health and disability in children under 5 years of age. A health  promotion mobile phone application, "Grow up Safely" (GUS), was developed to support  parents and carers in reducing unintentional injuries in this population of  children. METHODS: A prototype of the mobile application was developed to deliver  health education on unintentional injury prevention linked to stages of child  development. In order to explore the usability of the app and refine its content,  three focus groups were conducted with 15 mothers. Data were analysed using thematic  analysis. RESULTS: The majority of participants reported previous use of health  apps, mainly related to pregnancy and recommended by health professionals. The app  was considered user-friendly and easy to navigate. Participants in two focus groups  found the app informative and offered new information, and they would consider using  it. Participants in the "young mum's" group considered the advice to be "common  sense" but found the language too complex. All participants commented that further  development of push-out notifications and endorsement by a reputable source would  increase their engagement with the app. CONCLUSION: The GUS mobile phone app, aimed  at reducing unintentional injuries in children under five, was supported by mothers  as a health promotion app. They would consider downloading it, particularly if  recommended by a health professional or endorsed by a reputable organization.  Further development is planned with push-out notifications and wider feasibility  testing to engage targeted groups, such as young mothers, fathers, and other carers.

AB  - The distribution, quantification and exposure-related effects of radiation in the  environment, arising from both natural and anthropogenic sources, is of great (and  growing) concern for global populations. Recent events at the Fukushima Daiichi  Nuclear Plant (FDNPP) have further highlighted the importance of developing  radiation mapping technologies that not only contribute to the continued assessment  of contamination, but can serve as an educational tool for members of the public  regarding both its behaviour and extent. With an even greater number of people  possessing smart-phone technology, a lightweight and portable 'connected system' has  been developed to demonstrate to users the calibrated radioactive dose rate in an  area, viewable in real-time through a dedicated phone application. As well as  allowing for system users to be alerted where variations in dose rate are  experienced, the combined results from multiple systems are viewable through a  custom-built desktop application-permitting the output obtained via any number of  units to be similarly displayed in real-time. A successful initial trialling of the  system is described at a former tin mine in Cornwall (south-west England)-known to  exhibit low, but identifiable radiation anomalies in discrete areas. Additional  applications outside of its educational usage are also discussed.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The penetration of mobile phone devices is widespread across  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Recently, there has been evidence of the success of  phone-based applications in the provision of preventive oral health care to children  and their parents. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a  mobile phone-based application in educating mothers of children aged below 6 years  of age in preventive dental care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mobile phone-based  application (iTeethey™) was developed for iPhone and Android and made freely  available on Google Play and App Store. The application was then distributed to 3879  mothers of children below 6 years of age (1989 in Riyadh Region and 1890 in Najran  region). The mothers were subjected to a standardized knowledge attitude and  practice of oral hygiene questionnaire before being asked to download the  application. A total of 1055 mothers who downloaded the application completed  3-month recall process. RESULTS: Significant improvement in the knowledge of the  mothers was reported after the use of the application from both regions. The mothers  from Najran showed significantly greater improvement in knowledge when compared to  the mothers from Riyadh region. The application was also more effective in mothers  with more than one child when compared to first-time mothers. CONCLUSION: Within the  limitations of this study, we can state that the mobile phone application used in  this study significantly improves the knowledge of mothers toward their child's oral  health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breathlessness, the subjective sensation of breathing discomfort, is  common and appears in the daily life of people with cardiorespiratory diseases.  Physicians often rely on patient's history based on symptom recall. The relation  between recalled and experienced breathlessness is still poorly understood. This  paper presents the protocol for a study primarily aimed at evaluating the  relationship between experienced breathlessness and (1) recalled breathlessness and  (2) predicted future breathlessness. METHODS: A mobile phone application will be  used to collect data during daily life. Medically stable participants, ≥18 years of  age with mean daily breathlessness of Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 3/10 and able to  use a mobile phone with internet will rate their breathlessness intensity on a 0-10  NRS prompted the user several times daily for 1 week. Participants will recall their  breathlessness each day and week. Multivariable random effects regression models  will be used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Results of the study will be  submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant  conferences. DISCUSSION: This protocol describes a study aimed at investigating  previously unknown areas of the experience and recall of breathlessness using a new  method of data collection. REGISTRATION DETAILS: Prospectively registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov (Nr: NCT03468205). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has  received ethical approval from the Regional Ethical Review Board Lund (DNr  2017/149). After a general study information including that participation is  entirely voluntary, participants will answer the eligibility criteria and be asked  to consent to participate before entering the study questions. Written informed  consent to participate will be obtained for participants in the clinical sub-cohort.  Participation can be discontinued at the discretion of the participant in which case  no further data will be collected.

AB  - Personal assessments of body phenotype can enhance success in weight management but  are limited by the lack of availability of practical methods. We describe a novel  smart phone application of digital photography (DP) and determine its validity to  estimate fat mass (FM). This approach utilizes the percent (%) occupancy of an  individual lateral whole-body digital image and regions indicative of adipose  accumulation associated with increased risk of cardio-metabolic disease. We measured  117 healthy adults (63 females and 54 males aged 19 to 65 years) with DP and dual  X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and report here the development and validation of this  application. Inter-observer variability of the determination of % occupancy was  0.02%. Predicted and reference FM values were significantly related in females (R² =  0.949, SEE = 2.83) and males (R² = 0.907, SEE = 2.71). Differences between predicted  and measured FM values were small (0.02 kg, p = 0.96 and 0.07 kg, p = 0.96) for  females and males, respectively. No significant bias was found; limits of agreement  ranged from 5.6 to -5.4 kg for females and from 5.6 to -5.7 kg for males. These  promising results indicate that DP is a practical and valid method for personal body  composition assessments.

AB  - Emotional intelligence is established to predict success in leadership effectiveness  in various contexts and has been linked to personality factors. This paper  introduces Dharma Life Program, a novel approach to improving emotional intelligence  by targeting maladaptive personality traits and triggering neuroplasticity through  the use of a smart-phone application and mentoring. The program uses neuroplasticity  to enable users to create a more adaptive application of their maladaptive traits,  thus improving their emotional intelligence. In this study 26 participants underwent  the Dharma Life Program in a leadership development setting. We assessed their  emotional and social intelligence before and after the Dharma Life Program  intervention using the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI). The study  found a significant improvement in the lowest three competencies and a significant  improvement in almost all domains for the entire sample. Our findings suggest that  the completion of the Dharma Life Program has a significant positive effect on  Emotional and Social Competency scores and offers a new avenue for improving  emotional intelligence competencies.

AB  - PURPOSE: The scarcity of health care resources calls for their rational allocation,  including within hearing health care. Policies define the course of action to reach  specific goals such as optimal hearing health. The process of policy making can be  divided into 4 steps: (a) problem identification and issue recognition, (b) policy  formulation, (c) policy implementation, and (d) policy evaluation. Data and  evidence, especially Big Data, can inform each of the steps of this process. Big  Data can inform the macrolevel (policies that determine the general goals and  actions), mesolevel (specific services and guidelines in organizations), and  microlevel (clinical care) of hearing health care services. The research project  EVOTION applies Big Data collection and analysis to form an evidence base for future  hearing health care policies. METHOD: The EVOTION research project collects  heterogeneous data both from retrospective and prospective cohorts (clinical  validation) of people with hearing impairment. Retrospective data from clinical  repositories in the United Kingdom and Denmark will be combined. As part of a  clinical validation, over 1,000 people with hearing impairment will receive smart  EVOTION hearing aids and a mobile phone application from clinics located in the  United Kingdom and Greece. These clients will also complete a battery of  assessments, and a subsample will also receive a smartwatch including biosensors.  Big Data analytics will identify associations between client characteristics,  context, and hearing aid outcomes. RESULTS: The evidence EVOTION will generate is  relevant especially for the first 2 steps of the policy-making process, namely,  problem identification and issue recognition, as well as policy formulation. EVOTION  will inform microlevel, mesolevel, and macrolevel of hearing health care services  through evidence-informed policies, clinical guidelines, and clinical care.  CONCLUSION: In the future, Big Data can inform all steps of the hearing health  policy-making process and all levels of hearing health care services.

AB  - Acquisition and generalization of specific behavioral skills is a key component of  dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for individuals with borderline personality  disorder (BPD). We examined the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and immediate  effects of the DBT Coach, a mobile phone application (app) designed specifically to  augment skills generalization through interactive coaching in DBT skills. In this  pilot study, we provided the DBT Coach installed on a mobile device as an adjunct to  6 months of standard DBT, among a sample of 16 individuals with BPD and a recent  history of attempted suicide and/or nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Results indicate  good acceptability and usability of the DBT Coach with considerable between-person  variability in the frequency of app use and a median use of only 11.5 times over the  course of treatment and a 3-month follow-up period. Using a hierarchical linear  modeling approach, analyses indicated the DBT Coach reduced subjective distress and  urges to self-harm following app use. However, use of the DBT Coach was not related  to any treatment outcomes, except for reductions in NSSI. This study is the first to  examine the use of mobile technology as an adjunct in DBT and highlights some  potential challenges in incorporating apps into treatment. Implications for future  research and clinical utility are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile phone application that  calculates superior visual field defects on Goldmann visual field charts. METHODS:  Experimental study in which the mobile phone application and 14 oculoplastic  surgeons interpreted the superior visual field defect in 10 Goldmann charts. Percent  error of the mobile phone application and the oculoplastic surgeons' estimates were  calculated compared with computer software computation of the actual defects.  Precision and time efficiency of the application were evaluated by processing the  same Goldmann visual field chart 10 repeated times. RESULTS: The mobile phone  application was associated with a mean percent error of 1.98% (95% confidence  interval[CI], 0.87%-3.10%) in superior visual field defect calculation. The average  mean percent error of the oculoplastic surgeons' visual estimates was 19.75% (95%  CI, 14.39%-25.11%). Oculoplastic surgeons, on average, underestimated the defect in  all 10 Goldmann charts. There was high interobserver variance among oculoplastic  surgeons. The percent error of the 10 repeated measurements on a single chart was  0.93% (95% CI, 0.40%-1.46%). The average time to process 1 chart was 12.9 seconds  (95% CI, 10.9-15.0 seconds). CONCLUSIONS: The mobile phone application was highly  accurate, precise, and time-efficient in calculating the percent superior visual  field defect using Goldmann charts. Oculoplastic surgeon visual interpretations were  highly inaccurate, highly variable, and usually underestimated the field vision  loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary assessment methods that can provide high quality data while  limiting participant burden and resource requirements in epidemiological research  are highly sought after and continue to evolve. The use of mobile phone technology  in research has increased rapidly over the last decade and offers multiple  advantages to the researcher over traditional data collection methods. This study  tested the acceptability and relative validity of a commercial smart phone  application (app) for use as an epidemiological dietary assessment tool, compared  with a traditional dietary assessment method. METHODS: Study participants completed  a 4-d food diary using a modified version of the Easy Diet Diary app and two 24-h  dietary recalls during the same week, for comparison. At the end of data collection,  participants completed a questionnaire on their experience with both methods.  Average proportions of energy from macronutrients and fibre, iron, and calcium  densities from the app and 24-h recalls were compared after log transformation, by  calculating mean agreement, limits of agreement (LOA), and Pearson's correlations.  The prevalence of dietary under-reporting was compared in each method using the  Goldberg method. RESULTS: A total of 50 adults (82% women) provided data for  analysis (mean age, 31 y; mean BMI, 22.4 kg/m(2); 14% overweight or obese).  Participant feedback showed high levels of acceptance of the app; 83% preferred  using the app to completing 24-h dietary recalls. The average difference in energy  intake (mean agreement) between methods was 268 kJ/d. For all intakes except  alcohol, the average difference between methods was not significantly different from  zero. Most limits of agreement were within an acceptable range. The prevalence of  dietary misreporting was similar in both methods. CONCLUSIONS: These findings  demonstrate good feasibility for applying this commercially-developed smartphone app  in epidemiological research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: GPs detect at best 50c of mental health problems in young people.  Barriers to detecting mental health problems include lack of screening tools,  limited appointment times and young people's reluctance to report mental health  symptoms to GPs. The mobiletype program is a mobile phone mental health assessment  and management application which monitors mood, stress and everyday activities then  transmits this information to general practitioners (GPs) via a secure website in  summary format for medical review. The current aims were to examine: (i) mobiletype  as a clinical assistance tool, ii) doctor-patient rapport and, iii) pathways to  care. METHODS: We conducted a randomised controlled trial in primary care with  patients aged 14 to 24 years recruited from rural and metropolitan general  practices. GPs identified and referred eligible participants (those with mild or  more mental health concerns) who were randomly assigned to either the intervention  group (where mood, stress and daily activities were monitored) or the  attention-comparison group (where only daily activities were monitored). Both groups  self-monitored for 2 to 4 weeks and reviewed the monitoring data with their GP. GPs,  participants and researchers were blind to group allocation at randomisation. GPs  assessed the mobiletype program as a clinical assistant tool. Doctor-patient rapport  was assessed using the General Practice Assessment Questionnaire Communication and  Enablement subscales, and the Trust in Physician Scale (TPS). Pathways to care was  measured using The Party Project's Exit Interview. RESULTS: Of the 163 participants  assessed for eligibility, 118 were randomised and 114 participants were included in  analyses (intervention n = 68, attention-comparison n = 46). T-tests showed that the  intervention program increased understanding of patient mental health, assisted in  decisions about medication/referral and helped in diagnosis when compared to the  attention-comparison program. Mixed model analysis showed no differences in  GP-patient rapport nor in pathways to care. CONCLUSIONS: We conducted the first RCT  of a mobile phone application in the mental health assessment and management of  youth mental health in primary care. This study suggests that mobiletype has much to  offer GPs in the often difficult and time-consuming task of assessment and  management of youth mental health problems in primary care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) is a multi-sectoral approach  working to equalize opportunities and include people with disability in all aspects  of community life. Reliable and internationally comparable data needed to monitor  and evaluate CBR are scarce, partially due to the absence of standardized  indicators. The objective of this manuscript is to describe the collaborative  development process which led to the World Health Organization's (WHO) recently  launched set of standardized CBR outcome indicators. METHODS: The WHO's CBR  Guidelines recognize CBR as a comprehensive and multi-sectoral strategy, and were  therefore used as the starting point for the development of the indicators, in a  consensus process involving WHO and International Disability and Development  Consortium. Pilot implementations in Guatemala, Egypt and China using a specifically  developed mobile phone application to collect data, and an online expert survey were  completed to assess validity and feasibility of the indicators and their  corresponding questions. RESULTS: The indicator set includes 13 Base Indicators  which are broad enough to capture the situation of people with disability in  settings where CBR is carried out, independently of the specific CBR activities  carried out in a community; and 27 Supplementary Indicators that provide more  specific coverage and can be selected based on the specific goals of a CBR program.  CONCLUSION: The indicators were suitable to assess differences in health, education,  social life, livelihood and empowerment between people with disability and other  community members. This comparability provides valuable information to CBR managers,  donors and government agencies, to guide decision making, support advocacy and  improve accountability. The CBR indicators will support WHO and its member states in  their efforts towards strengthening CBR, by generating evidence on its  effectiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In an oversaturated market of publicly available mobile apps for  psychosocial self-care and stress management, health care providers, patients, and  consumers interested in mental health-related apps may wonder which, if any, are  efficacious. Readily available metrics for consumers include user popularity and  media buzz rather than scientific evidence. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed  to (1) examine the breadth of therapeutic contents and features of psychosocial  wellness and stress management apps available to self-help seekers for public  download and (2) determine which of these apps have original research support.  METHODS: First, we conducted a systematic review of publicly available apps on the  iPhone App Store (Apple Inc) and Android Google Play (Google LLC) platforms using  conventional self-help-seeking search terms related to wellness and stress. The  results were limited to English-language apps available for free download. In total,  2 reviewers independently evaluated all apps and discussed the findings to reach  100% consensus regarding inclusion. Second, a literature review was conducted on the  included apps to identify supporting studies with original data collection. RESULTS:  We screened 3287 apps and found 1009 psychosocial wellness and stress management  apps. Content varied widely. The most common evidence-based strategy was  mindfulness-meditation, followed by positive psychology and goal setting. Most apps  were intended to be used as self-help interventions, with only 1.09% (11/1009)  involving an electronic therapist and 1.88% (19/1009) designed as a supplement to  in-person psychotherapy. Only 4.66% (47/1009) of apps targeted individuals with  psychological disorders, and less than 1% of apps (6/1009, 0.59%) targeted  individuals with other chronic illnesses. Approximately 2% (21/1009, 2.08%) were  supported by original research publications, with a total of 25 efficacy studies and  10 feasibility studies. The Headspace mindfulness app had the most evidence,  including 8 efficacy studies. Most other scientifically backed apps were supported  by a single feasibility or efficacy study. CONCLUSIONS: Only 2.08% (21/1009) of  publicly available psychosocial wellness and stress management mobile apps  discoverable to self-help seekers have published, peer-reviewed evidence of  feasibility and/or efficacy. Clinicians and investigators may use these findings to  help patients and families navigate the volume of emerging digital health  interventions for stress management and wellness.

AB  - SUMMARY: Mechanistic molecular studies in biomedical research often discover  important genes that are aberrantly over- or under-expressed in disease. However,  manipulating these genes in an attempt to improve the disease state is challenging.  Herein, we reveal Drug Gene Budger (DGB), a web-based and mobile application  developed to assist investigators in order to prioritize small molecules that are  predicted to maximally influence the expression of their target gene of interest.  With DGB, users can enter a gene symbol along with the wish to up-regulate or  down-regulate its expression. The output of the application is a ranked list of  small molecules that have been experimentally determined to produce the desired  expression effect. The table includes log-transformed fold change, P-value and  q-value for each small molecule, reporting the significance of differential  expression as determined by the limma method. Relevant links are provided to further  explore knowledge about the target gene, the small molecule and the source of  evidence from which the relationship between the small molecule and the target gene  was derived. The experimental data contained within DGB is compiled from signatures  extracted from the LINCS L1000 dataset, the original Connectivity Map (CMap) dataset  and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). DGB also presents a specificity measure for a  drug-gene connection based on the number of genes a drug modulates. DGB provides a  useful preliminary technique for identifying small molecules that can target the  expression of a single gene in human cells and tissues. AVAILABILITY AND  IMPLEMENTATION: The application is freely available on the web at http://DGB.cloud  and as a mobile phone application on iTunes  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drug-gene-budger/id1243580241? mt=8 and Google Play  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details? id=com.drgenebudger.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic stress is an independent risk factor for essential hypertension  (EH), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and is sometimes confronted by mal-adaptive  coping behaviors (e.g., stress eating, excessive alcohol consumption, etc.).  Pre-essential hypertension (preEH) is the leading predictor of future EH status.  Breathing awareness meditation (BAM) can result in clinically beneficial blood  pressure (BP) reductions, though face-to-face sessions presents barriers to reach  those in need. The purpose of this study was to identify if a culturally tailored  approach is needed in the design and preferences between groups of preEH African  American and White adults toward using a smartphone BAM app, the Tension Tamer (TT)  app. METHODS: TT includes audio delivered BAM instructions, real-time heart rate,  feedback graphs and motivational reinforcement text messaging. Questionnaires and  two focus groups each of African American and White adults, [n=34, mean age =43.1  years, (SD 13.8 years), 44.1% African American] were conducted to understand stress,  EH knowledge, app usage along with feedback from a hands-on demonstration of TT.  Grounded theory using NVivo 10 was used to develop themes and combined with the  questionnaires in the analysis. RESULTS: No racial differences were found in the  analysis including app use scenarios, preferences, knowledge, technology use or the  attitudes and acceptance toward mobile health (mHealth) programs. Reported stress  was high for African Americans [PSS-4: mean 6.87 (SD 3.3) versus mean 4.56 (SD 2.6);  P=0.03]. Four main themes were found: (I) stress was pervasive; (II) coping  strategies were both positive and negative; (III) BAM training was easy to  incorporated; and (IV) tracking stress responses was useful. Responses suggest that  additional personalization of app interfaces may drive ownership and adherence to  protocols. Measures and reports of heart rate monitoring while in session were  favorably viewed with low issues with confidentiality or trust issues on collected  session data. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that a culturally tailored approach may  be unnecessary in the design of BAM apps. Further investigation is warranted for  other racial groups, age ranges, and disease conditions.

TI  - Automated decision support in melanocytic lesion management.
AU  - Gilmore, Stephen J.
T2  - PloS one
AB  - An automated melanocytic lesion image-analysis algorithm is described that aims to  reproduce the decision-making of a dermatologist. The utility of the algorithm lies  in its ability to identify lesions requiring excision from lesions not requiring  excision. Using only wavelet coefficients as features, and testing three different  machine learning algorithms, a cohort of 250 images of pigmented lesions is  classified based on expert dermatologists' recommendations of either excision (165  images) or no excision (85 images). It is shown that the best algorithm utilises the  Shannon4 wavelet coupled to the support vector machine, where the latter is used as  the classifier. In this case the algorithm, utilising only 22 othogonal features,  achieves a 10-fold cross validation sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 and 0.87,  resulting in a diagnostic-odds ratio of 261. The advantages of this method over  diagnostic algorithms-which make a melanoma/no melanoma decision-are twofold: first,  by reproducing the decision-making of a dermatologist, the average number of lesions  excised per melanoma among practioners in general can be reduced without  compromising the detection of melanoma; and second, the intractable problem of  clinically differentiating between many atypical dysplastic naevi and melanoma is  avoided. Since many atypical naevi that require excision on clinical grounds will  not be melanoma, the algorithm-in contrast to diagnostic algorithms-can aim for  perfect specificities without clinical concerns, thus lowering the excision rate of  non-melanoma. Finally, the algorithm has been implemented as a smart phone  application to investigate its utility in clinical practice and to streamline the  assimilation of hitherto unseen tested images into the training set.

AB  - In Northern Canada, climate change has led to many acute and interrelated health and  environmental impacts experienced among Inuit populations. Community-based  monitoring, in which community members participate in monitoring initiatives using  various forms of technology, is a key strategy increasingly used to detect, monitor  and respond to climate change impacts. To better understand the landscape of  existing environmental and health monitoring programmes mobilising different  technologies and operating in the North we conducted a review that used  environmental scan methodologies to explore and contextualise these programmes. We  consulted with academic researchers with experience in community-led monitoring,  conducted systematic searches of grey and peer-reviewed literature, and conducted a  secondary search for environment-health mobile-phone applications. Following  specific criteria, we identified 18 monitoring programmes using information and  communication technologies in the North, and three global monitoring mobile-phone  applications, which cumulatively monitored 74 environment and health indicators.  Several themes emerged, including the need for: (1) community leadership, (2)  indicators of environment and/or human health and (3) innovative technology. This  synthesis supports the development of community-led, environment-health monitoring  programmes that use innovative technology to monitor and share information related  to the health implications of climate change in and around Indigenous communities  throughout the Circumpolar North.

AB  - AIM: To validate the Peek Acuity mobile phone application in pediatric populations  and compare its utility, both economic and diagnostic, against conventional  screening methods using a pediatric ophthalmologist examination as the gold  standard. METHODS: A cohort of 393 subjects from Fernando de la Mora, Paraguay (ages  6-16y) were enrolled in the study. Subjects were randomly assigned a starting  screening modality among: Peek Acuity, a single line of tumbling E optotypes set at  20/40, and Spot Vision Screener. Once completing the first screening modality, the  subjects completed the two remaining techniques. Referral criteria were established  based on the most current American Association of Pediatric Ophthalmology and  Strabismus (AAPOS) recommendations: 20/40 for Peek Acuity and the tumbling E, and  refractive error detection for the Spot Vision Screener. Subjects that failed to  achieve the cut-off for any of the three screening techniques or subjects that  passed the screening but were randomly selected to perform a comprehensive eye exam  to determine the false negative rate, were evaluated by a pediatric ophthalmologist.  This evaluation was considered the gold standard, and included vision assessment by  a Snellen chart, strabismus evaluation, and cycloplegic refraction with dilated  fundoscopy. RESULTS: We obtained 48% sensitivity, 83% specificity, 43% positive  predictive value, and 86% negative predictive value for Peek Acuity's ability to  refer compared to evaluation by a pediatric ophthalmologist, failing to achieve a  desired sensitivity for implementation. Peek Acuity trended to overestimate the  subject's visual acuity, providing a higher visual acuity that would not indicate  referral for a comprehensive eye examination. However, its high specificity  accurately predicted a significant number of children who did not need further  evaluation. When comparing the three screening methods, no single screening modality  outperformed the others. Peek Acuity represented a technology that was economically  feasible compared to other screening modalities in low income settings, due to the  prevalence of cell phone use. CONCLUSION: Peek Acuity represents an efficient tool  that has potential for implementation in school screenings with different strategies  aimed at pediatric populations due to its low cost and high specificity. An increase  in sensitivity would improve detection of children with refractive errors.

TI  - Your Personal Motivator is with You: A Systematic Review of Mobile Phone  Applications Aiming at Increasing Physical Activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Literature shows mixed evidence about the power of mobile phone  applications to foster physical activity. A systematic integration that offers  insights into which mobile phone application techniques can or cannot foster  physical activity is lacking, as is a theoretical integration of current research.  OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review guided by a theoretical framework  focusing on effects that certain mobile phone application techniques have on  physical activity, to improve our understanding of what techniques are more or less  effective. METHODS: We identified articles by searching EBSCO Business Source  Complete, Science Direct, PsycINFO, Springer, PLoS ONE, Taylor and Francis, IEEE,  Social Science Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded, PUBMED, MEDLINE, and  Google Scholar. We considered articles if (1) they referred to the use of mobile  phone applications to promote physical activity; (2) their methodological approach  allowed one to derive appropriate results (e.g., intervention-based approach,  observational study); (3) they were published in peer-reviewed journals or  conference proceedings; and (4) they were written in English. The literature search  resulted in 41 usable studies. Meta-synthesis and vote counting were applied to  analyze these studies. RESULTS: Based on the ratio of supportive versus  non-supportive evidence in both the qualitative and the quantitative studies, we  propose the following descending rank order for the effectiveness of application  techniques to foster physical activity. This is tentative in nature because the  current overall small body of literature made coming to definite conclusions  difficult: (1) feedback, (2) goal setting and its sub-forms, (3) competition, social  sharing with familiar users in both segregated and social network groups, and (4)  social sharing with strangers in segregated groups, reward, and social sharing with  strangers in social network groups. Rewards in particular provided mixed results,  and social sharing with strangers in segregated and social network groups seemed  rather ineffective but may work under special conditions that need to be identified  in additional research. One limitation of our study was that our results are mostly  derived from qualitative studies, since quantitative studies are underrepresented in  the field. CONCLUSION: Several mobile phone application techniques were identified  that have the potential to foster physical activity, whereas others were identified  that are unlikely to increase physical activity. Major avenues for future research  include more theoretical development and more quantitative studies, among others.

AB  - Dietary restriction contributes to disordered eating (DE) behaviors and associated  cognitions. However, it is unclear how these outcomes are impacted by dietary  restriction for religious purposes, such as fasting observed by Muslims during  Ramadan. Using ecological momentary assessment, this study assessed the impact of  Ramadan fasting on DE behaviors and correlates. Muslim participants fasting during  Ramadan (n = 28) and a control group of non-fasting participants (n = 74) completed  baseline measures assessing demographic characteristics and eating pathology. A  mobile phone application then prompted participants six times per day for seven days  to self-report on dietary restriction efforts, body satisfaction, temptation to eat  unhealthily, feelings of guilt or shame following food, and DE behaviors including  bingeing, vomiting, and other purging behaviors (use of laxatives, diuretics, or  diet pills). After controlling for eating pathology, multilevel modeling indicated  that, as expected, the Ramadan fasting group spent significantly more time  restricting food intake than the non-fasting group. The Ramadan fasting group also  experienced significantly greater temptation to eat unhealthily than their  non-fasting counterparts. However, this difference disappeared once models were  adjusted for differences in time spent restricting food intake. There were no other  significant differences between the groups on any DE variables. These findings  suggest that while dietary restriction for health or appearance-related reasons is a  known contributor to DE, dietary restriction for religious purposes, such as that  observed during the practice of Ramadan, may not confer increased risk of DE  symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication non-adherence in transplant patients is a grave problem that  results in increased rejection episodes, graft loss and significant morbidity.  METHODS: The efficacy of users and non-users of a mobile phone application (mobile  app) in promoting medication adherence was investigated. The Beliefs about Medicine  Questionnaire (BMQ) and Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) were used in  these cohorts to assess the predilection for poor adherence. Serum tacrolimus,  creatinine levels, and rejection episodes were also recorded. Lastly, the patients  were tested on their recall of their immunosuppression. RESULTS: Overall, patients  had extremely negative beliefs about medication reflected in their tendency toward  higher predicted rates of non-adherence. Interestingly, though not significant, app  users had higher rates of medication recollection. CONCLUSIONS: The high-risk nature  of this population demands efforts to abrogate non-adherence. Caregivers are charged  with the responsibility to offer patients a feasible option to safeguard treatment  compliance. Mobile apps are a potentially powerful tool, which can be used to  decrease non-adherence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Differences in partner services outcomes in men who have sex with men  (MSM) by HIV serostatus have not been explored as a potential driver of differential  early syphilis (ES) burden in this population. METHODS: We compared partner services  outcomes (number of partners named, notified, tested, diagnosed, and treated)  between HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM initiated for ES partner services in Texas  from 2013 to 2016 using logistic regression and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests.  Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between HIV serostatus and  having a no-partner-initiated (NPI) partner services interview controlling for  demographic characteristics, prior partner services interactions, and geosocial  phone application use. RESULTS: A total of 4161 HIV-positive MSM and 5254  HIV-negative MSM were initiated for ES partner services. HIV-positive MSM named  fewer partners than did HIV-negative MSM (mean, 1.2 vs. 1.9; P < 0.001) and had  lower indices of partners notified, tested, diagnosed, and treated. HIV  seropositivity was significantly associated with NPI. However, this association was  not significant when limited to MSM with previous partner services interviews  (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 1.06; P = 0.38); in this subset of MSM, using geosocial  phone application was negatively associated with having an NPI interview (aRR,  0.90), and having 1 (aRR, 1.33) or more than 1 previous NPI interview (aRR, 1.57)  was associated with an NPI interview during the study period. CONCLUSIONS:  Suboptimal outcomes for syphilis partner service may result in missed opportunities  for testing and treatment of sexual contacts, which could allow for propagation of  syphilis. Implementation of innovative protocols is needed to ensure that partner  services continue to be an effective and acceptable method of syphilis disease  intervention in MSM.

AB  - The New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene released the Teens  in NYC mobile phone application (app) in 2013 as part of a program to promote sexual  and reproductive health among adolescents aged 12-19 in NYC. The app featured a  locator that allowed users to search for health service providers by sexual health  services, contraceptive methods, and geographic locations. We analyzed data on  searches from the Where to Go section of the app to understand the patterns of use  of the app's search functionality. From January 7, 2013, through March 20, 2016, the  app was downloaded more than 20 000 times, and more than 25 000 unique searches were  conducted within the app. Results suggest that the app helped adolescents discover  and access a wide range of sexual health services, including less commonly used  contraceptives. Those designing similar apps should consider incorporating search  functionality by sexual health service (including abortion), contraceptive method,  and user location.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the education  system using social media. Eight educational video clips were developed instructing  the viewer on cancer-related issues such as prevention, treatment, and survivorship.  Each video was made with participation of medical professors and posted on a YouTube  channel. A mobile phone application was produced containing a scheduler function,  introduction of a community cancer center program, and cancer information. A medical  blog was established to provide stationary materials such as images and articles.  Descriptive analysis was done by Google analytics. From May of 2014 to June of 2016,  15,247 total views were recorded on the YouTube channel, and the average view  duration was about 3 min. The most popular video was about chemotherapy treatment;  5409 (36%) people watched this video, and 3615 (23.5%) people viewed a video on  balanced dietary habits. As well as South Korea, 1,113 (7%) views were confirmed in  the United States and 175 (1%) in Japan. The equipment used to watch the contents  were mobile phones (59%), laptops (33%), and tablets (6%). Five hundred people  installed the smartphone application from March of 2015 to July of 2016. Three  hundred eighty-three medical contents were posted on the blog since March of 2015.  Cancer education is necessary to address the education needs of patients with cancer  and their caregivers. Education based on social media could be an effective method  that reaches beyond geographical boundaries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over 75% of mental health problems begin in adolescence and primary care  has been identified as the target setting for mental health intervention by the  World Health Organisation. The mobiletype program is a mental health assessment and  management mobile phone application which monitors mood, stress, coping strategies,  activities, eating, sleeping, exercise patterns, and alcohol and cannabis use at  least daily, and transmits this information to general practitioners (GPs) via a  secure website in summary format for medical review. METHODS: We conducted a  randomised controlled trial in primary care to examine the mental health benefits of  the mobiletype program. Patients aged 14 to 24 years were recruited from rural and  metropolitan general practices. GPs identified and referred eligible participants  (those with mild or more mental health concerns) who were randomly assigned to  either the intervention group (where mood, stress, and daily activities were  monitored) or the attention comparison group (where only daily activities were  monitored). Both groups self-monitored for 2 to 4 weeks and reviewed the monitoring  data with their GP. GPs, participants, and researchers were blind to group  allocation at randomisation. Participants completed pre-, post-, and 6-week  post-test measures of the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale and an Emotional Self  Awareness (ESA) Scale. RESULTS: Of the 163 participants assessed for eligibility,  118 were randomised and 114 participants were included in analyses (intervention  group n = 68, comparison group n = 46). Mixed model analyses revealed a significant  group by time interaction on ESA with a medium size of effect suggesting that the  mobiletype program significantly increases ESA compared to an attention comparison.  There was no significant group by time interaction for depression, anxiety, or  stress, but a medium to large significant main effect for time for each of these  mental health measures. Post-hoc analyses suggested that participation in the RCT  lead to enhanced GP mental health care at pre-test and improved mental health  outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring mental health symptoms appears to increase ESA and  implementing a mental health program in primary care and providing frequent  reminders, clinical resources, and support to GPs substantially improved mental  health outcomes for the sample as a whole.

AB  - There has been growing interest in utilizing mobile phone applications (apps) to  enhance traditional psychotherapy. Previous research has suggested that apps may  facilitate patients' completion of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)  tasks and potentially increase adherence. This randomized clinical trial pilot study  ( n = 18) sought to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact on  adherence and sleep outcomes related to CBT-I Coach use. All participants were  engaged in CBT-I, with one group receiving the app as a supplement and one non-app  group. We found that patients consistently used the app as intended, particularly  the sleep diary and reminder functions. They reported that it was highly acceptable  to use. Importantly, the app did not compromise or undermine benefits of cognitive  behavioral therapy for insomnia and patients in both groups had significantly  improved sleep outcomes following treatment.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth intervention in improving knowledge  and skills of accredited social health activists in improving maternal, newborn and  child health care in India. METHODS: This was a nested cross-sectional study within  a cluster randomised controlled trial. The intervention was a mobile phone  application which has inbuilt health education videos, algorithms to diagnose  complications and training tools to educate accredited social health activists. A  total of 124 were randomly selected from the control (n = 61) and intervention  (n = 63) arms of the larger study after six months of training in Bharuch and  Narmada districts of Gujarat. RESULTS: The knowledge of accredited social health  activists regarding pregnancy (OR: 2.51, CI: 1.12-5.64) and newborn complications  (OR: 2.57, CI: 1.12-5.92) was significantly higher in the intervention arm compared  to the control arm. The knowledge of complications during delivery (OR: 1.36, CI:  0.62-2.98) and the postpartum (OR: 1.06, CI: 0.48-2.33) period was similar in both  groups. The activists from the intervention arm demonstrated better skills for  measuring temperature (OR: 4.25, CI: 1.66-10.89) of newborns compared to the control  group. CONCLUSION: The results suggest potential benefits of this mHealth  intervention for improving knowledge and skills of accredited social health  activists.

Apps with descriptions indicating that  they targeted the intended audience and included evidence-related terminology, at  least one evidence-based stress management strategy, and behavior change components  were downloaded and evaluated by two independent raters across the three domains of  evidence-based content, transparency, and functionality. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total  of 902 apps were identified based on 21 searches. Of these, 60 met study criteria  and were downloaded and evaluated between April and June 2015. Twenty (33%)  ultimately did not deliver an evidence-based strategy. Of the delivered strategies,  the most common were mindfulness and meditation (73%) and diaphragmatic breathing  (25%). On average, apps addressed half of the transparency criteria, and nearly all  (85%) were acceptable across usability criteria. A total of 32 apps included both  evidence-based content and exhibited no problems with usability or functionality;  apps affiliated with a non-profit, research-engaged institution comprised 31% of  these. CONCLUSIONS: This review evaluated 60 iOS apps for stress management across  domains of evidence-based content, transparency, and functionality; these apps have  the potential to effectively supplement medical care. Findings further indicate that  a comprehensive, multi-domain approach can distinguish apps that use evidence-based  strategies from those that do not.

AB  - In situ asbestos in the built environment is a remaining source of exposure in  countries that have prohibited the manufacture and use of asbestos. However, it is  difficult to identify in situ asbestos-containing material in residential settings.  The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the mobile phone  application ("app"), ACM Check, in identifying in situ asbestos located inside and  outside of homes compared with onsite inspections conducted by an experienced  environmental consultant. A cross-sectional study was undertaken that involved  participants completing ACM Check on their homes built pre-1990 and located  throughout metropolitan Perth, Western Australia, and an onsite inspection conducted  at each home by an environmental consultant. Cohen's kappa statistic was calculated  to evaluate the strength of agreement between the two methods. The 40 houses sampled  were built between 1898 and 1988 with a median year of 1966. Thirty-eight (95%)  homes had at least one type of material categorized as positive for asbestos by both  ACM Check and the environmental consultant (κ = 1.00). Agreement between the two  methods differed when categorizing specific materials as positive or negative for  asbestos with substantial agreement for fencing (κ = 0.918), outbuilding walls  (κ = 0.844), backing board to electrical meter box (κ = 0.826), exterior wall  cladding (κ = 0.771), and interior walls (κ = 0.754), and fair agreement for  outbuilding roofs (κ = 0.375) and interior flooring (κ = 0.304). ACM Check is a tool  that can be used by tradespeople, home renovators, and householders to screen  residential settings for the presence of in situ asbestos-containing material.  Mobile phone apps have the potential to be developed or modified for use in other  countries to help users identify asbestos and reduce their risk of asbestos  exposure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Engagement in online programs is difficult to maintain. Gamification is  the recent trend that offers to increase engagement through the inclusion of  game-like features like points and badges, in non-game contexts. This review will  answer the following question, 'Are gamification strategies effective in increasing  engagement in online programs?' METHOD: Eight databases (Web of Science, PsycINFO,  Medline, INSPEC, ERIC, Cochrane Library, Business Source Complete and ACM Digital  Library) were searched from 2010 to the 28th of October 2015 using a comprehensive  search strategy. Eligibility criteria was based on the PICOS format, where  "population" included adults, "intervention" involved an online program or smart  phone application that included at least one gamification feature. "Comparator" was  a control group, "outcomes" included engagement and "downstream" outcomes which  occurred as a result of engagement; and "study design" included experimental studies  from peer-reviewed sources. Effect sizes (Cohens d and 95% confidence intervals)  were also calculated. RESULTS: 1017 studies were identified from database searches  following the removal of duplicates, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The  studies involved a total of 10,499 participants, and were commonly undertaken in  tertiary education contexts. Engagement metrics included time spent (n = 5), volume  of contributions (n = 11) and occasions visited to the software (n = 4); as well as  downstream behaviours such as performance (n = 4) and healthy behaviours (n = 1).  Effect sizes typically ranged from medium to large in direct engagement and  downstream behaviours, with 12 out of 15 studies finding positive significant  effects in favour of gamification. CONCLUSION: Gamification is effective in  increasing engagement in online programs. Key recommendations for future research  into gamification are provided. In particular, rigorous study designs are required  to fully examine gamification's effects and determine how to best achieve sustained  engagement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low physical activity level is associated with poor prognosis in  patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). To increase physical activity,  technology-based platforms are emerging and provide intriguing opportunities to  prescribe and monitor active lifestyle interventions. The "Interval Walking in  Colorectal Cancer"(I-WALK-CRC) study explores the feasibility and efficacy a  home-based interval-walking intervention delivered by a smart-phone application in  order to improve cardio-metabolic health profile among CRC survivors. The aim of the  present report is to describe the design, methods and recruitment results of the  I-WALK-CRC study.Methods/Results: The I-WALK-CRC study is a randomized controlled  trial designed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based interval  walking intervention compared to a waiting-list control group for physiological and  patient-reported outcomes. Patients who had completed surgery for local stage  disease and patients who had completed surgery and any adjuvant chemotherapy for  locally advanced stage disease were eligible for inclusion. Between October 1st(,)  2015, and February 1st(,) 2017, 136 inquiries were recorded; 83 patients were  eligible for enrollment, and 42 patients accepted participation. Age and employment  status were associated with participation, as participants were significantly  younger (60.5 vs 70.8 years, P < 0.001) and more likely to be working (OR 5.04;  95%CI 1.96-12.98, P < 0.001) than non-participants. CONCLUSION: In the present  study, recruitment of CRC survivors was feasible but we aim to better the  recruitment rate in future studies. Further, the study clearly favored younger  participants. The I-WALK-CRC study will provide important information regarding  feasibility and efficacy of a home-based walking exercise program in CRC survivors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle changes and the adoption of healthy behaviours are well  established recommendations for the management of hypertension-a risk factor for  cardiovascular and kidney disease. Mobile health interventions offer unique  advantages and novel approaches to helping individuals make and maintain such  behaviour changes; however, current interventions often lack theoretical and  scientific grounding. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to effectively model the  knowledge, concepts and relationships relevant to the management of a chronic  illness like hypertension, and to implement this knowledge model within a mobile  self-management application that can be used by patients. METHODS: A behaviour  modification approach based on COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation,  behaviour) Model and the associated Behaviour Change Wheel was developed. An  ontology-based knowledge model was implemented to formally conceptualise relevant  knowledge in hypertension clinical practice guidelines, behaviour change models and  associated behaviour change strategies. A hypertension management decision support  framework was designed and implemented as a proof-of-concept mobile phone  application (EmpowerBP) using the aforementioned model. The usability of this pilot  application was tested using think-aloud protocol by eight individuals with  hypertension while performing predefined tasks. Thematic analysis with inductive  thematic coding was performed to identify specific feedback and areas for  improvement. RESULTS: The most common positive feedback included participants  finding application resources interesting or helpful and liking the user interface.  The most common negative feedback was finding the included salt calculator confusing  or laborious to use and finding the profile creation questionnaire too long. The  derived themes were: features, profile creation, resources, scenario, usability,  user interface. CONCLUSIONS: The ontology knowledge model formalises variables,  properties, and relationships such that they can be used for problem solving. By  integrating and computerising complex knowledge from clinical practice guidelines,  behaviour change theories, and associated behaviour change strategies, it is  possible to model existing information about the management of hypertension as an  ontology. This proof-of-concept application creates clinical and behavioural  profiles of a user to provide them with personalised management strategies, rooted  in established behaviour change theory, that will engage and empower them to manage  their condition. Given the nature of ontological models, this approach can be easily  modified to address a variety of chronic illnesses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The period of transition from pediatric to adult services represents a  time when young people need support, information, and appropriate care in order to  successfully move. It is a period that is associated with nonadherence and  disengagement with care. OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences of young liver  transplant recipients transitioning to adult services and determine what they  require in order to achieve a successful move. The research also explored the  possibility of using a mobile phone application (app) as a tool to support  transition. DESIGN: Qualitative approach using novel arts-based focus groups and  one-to-one interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one young people aged 16 to 25 years, 16  health-care professionals involved in their care, and 7 young people as follow-up.  Participants used services provided by the 3 liver centers in England (Leeds,  Birmingham, and London). RESULTS: Data highlighted the variability of transition  pathways in England for young people moving from child to adult health services. The  results showed that they required clear information regarding transition processes  including specific medical information and that there was a shortfall in such  information. Support was required in the form of a designated transition coordinator  or similar specialist who could act as a point of reference and guidance throughout  the process. Transitions needed to be individualized and based upon transition  readiness rather than age, although the research showed that age cut-offs were still  used. CONCLUSION: Young people welcomed apps to provide information, reminders,  contacts, and connections. Future research should explore the efficacy of such apps.

T2  - Plastic surgery (Oakville, Ont.)
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within the field of plastic surgery, clinical photography is an  essential tool. 'Smart phones' are increasingly being used for photography in  medical settings. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of smart phone use for  clinical photography among plastic surgeons and plastic surgery residents in Canada.  METHODS: In 2014, a survey was distributed to all members of the Canadian Society of  Plastic Surgeons. The questions encompassed four main categories: smart phone use  for clinical photos; storage of photos; consent process; and privacy issues. The  survey participation rate was 27% (147 of 545) with 103 surgeons and 44 residents.  In total, 89.1% (131 of 147) of respondents have taken photographs of patients using  smart phones and 57% (74 of 130) store these photos on their phones. In addition,  73% (74 of 102) of respondents store these photos among personal photos. The  majority of respondents (75% [106 of 142]) believe obtaining verbal consent before  taking clinical photographs is sufficient to ensure privacy is respected. Written  consent is not commonly obtained, but 83% (116 of 140) would obtain it, if it could  be done more efficiently. Twenty-six percent (31 of 119) of respondents have  accidentally shown a clinical photograph on their phone to friends or family. A  smart phone application that incorporates a written consent process, and allows  photos to be immediately stored externally, is perceived by 59% (83 of 140) to be a  possible way to address these issues. CONCLUSION: Smart phones are commonly used to  obtain clinical photographs in plastic surgery. There are issues around consent  process, storage of photos and privacy that need to be addressed.

AB  - After total hip replacement and total knee replacement, patients are highly  recommended to take walking rehabilitation, during which time, the weight loads on  the limb should be limited to a certain range, which is difficult for patients to  control on their own. To improve the accuracy and reliability of the traditional  method for walking rehabilitation, we proposed a monitoring system comprised of  pressure sensors, an analog digital converter, a micro-control unit, Bluetooth  modules and a smart-phone application. Except for this application, the system is  embedded in the customized shoes. When patients wear the shoes, the weight load data  will be detected by the pressure sensors, and transmitted to the smart-phone  application wirelessly in real time. Whenever the system detects too much weight on  a patient's limb or an impending patient fall and abnormal gait, an algorithm, also  proposed in this study, instructs the smart phone to sound an alarm. In addition, we  present and test a gait evaluation algorithm that analyzes the patient's gait.  Measurement results show that the accuracy of the system is 0.5kg.

AB  - We present the findings of a qualitative pilot study designed to describe the  experience of HIV medication adherence using a mobile phone application. Nine  semi-structured focus group discussions were conducted over a 3-month period at an  AIDS Services Organization in Central Texas. The data were analyzed following the  principles of thematic analysis. During analysis, four themes were identified, and  relations between these themes were delineated to reflect the experiences of the 23  participants. The mobile phone application, Care4Today™ Mobile Health Manager, was  the intervention tool. Collection of focus group discussion outcomes over a 3-month  period with baseline versus end-of-study data determined the feasibility and  acceptability of this medication adherence intervention. The findings suggest that  when individuals are offered the necessary resources, such as a mobile phone  medication reminder application, they may have greater success in performing the  behavior.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Circle of Six (Co6) phone application (app), winner of the White  House's Apps Against Abuse Challenge, seeks to incorporate friends into sexual  victimization risk reduction. Despite its growing presence on college campuses, the  feasibility/acceptability of the app to college women is unknown. This mixed methods  study sought to fill this gap. PARTICIPANTS: College women (n = 44) participated in  summer/fall 2015. METHODS: Participants completed questionnaires, used the Co6 app  for 2 months, and returned to report their experiences. RESULTS: Consistent with the  app's aim, women reported greater intentions to help friends versus strangers in  sexually aggressive situations. However, app use was low over follow-up. Reasons  women gave for not using the app included redundancy with existing smart phone  features and discomfort with group messaging. Some saw the app as an emergency only  resource. CONCLUSIONS: The Co6 app may not meet the real world needs of college  women.

T2  - Evidence-based mental health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health offers many opportunities; however, the 'side-effects' of  health apps are often unclear. With no guarantee health apps first do no harm, their  role as a viable, safe and effective therapeutic option is limited. OBJECTIVE: To  assess the quality of apps for chronic insomnia disorder, available on the Android  Google Play Store, and determine whether a novel approach to app assessment could  identify high-quality and low-risk health apps in the absence of indicators such as  National Health Service (NHS) approval. METHODS: The Organisation for the Review of  Care and Health Applications- 24 Question Assessment (ORCHA-24), 24 app assessment  criteria concerning data privacy, clinical efficacy and user experience, answered on  a 'yes' or 'no' and evidence-driven basis, was applied to assess 18 insomnia apps  identified via the Android Google Play Store, in addition to the NHS-approved iOS  app Sleepio. FINDINGS: 63.2% of apps (12/19) provided a privacy policy, with seven  (36.8%) stating no user data would be shared without explicit consent. 10.5% (2/19)  stated they had been shown to be of benefit to those with insomnia, with cognitive  behavioural therapy apps outperforming hypnosis and meditation apps (p=0.046). Both  the number of app downloads (p=0.29) and user-review scores (p=0.23) were unrelated  to ORCHA-24 scores. The NHS-approved app Sleepio, consistently outperformed  non-accredited apps across all domains of the ORCHA-24. CONCLUSIONS: Apps for  chronic insomnia disorder exhibit substantial variation in adherence to published  data privacy, user experience and clinical efficacy standards, which are not clearly  correlated with app downloads or user-review scores. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In  absence of formal app accreditation, the ORCHA-24 could feasibly be used to  highlight the risk-benefit profiles of health apps prior to downloading.

AB  - AIMS: Psychotic symptoms fluctuate over time and effective and regular monitoring  may contribute to relapse prevention and improve long-term outcomes. In this  proof-of-concept study we test the feasibility, acceptability and potential  usefulness of a novel digital method assessing the association between physiological  signals and psychotic symptom distress. METHODS: Fifteen participants with first  episode psychosis were asked to use a self-assessment mobile phone application for  psychotic symptom monitoring for 10 days while using a wrist worn device  continuously recording heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity  (EDA). We compared physiological activity when participants reported experiencing  distressing and non-distressing psychotic symptoms. RESULTS: Participants completed  on average 76% of the mobile phone symptom assessments. When reporting distressing  hallucinations and delusions participants had significantly higher EDA levels and  non-significant lower HRV values compared to when these symptoms were  non-distressing. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence linking psychotic  symptom's distress, as experienced in everyday life, and autonomic deregulation.  This proof-of-concept study may lead to further longer-term efforts to identify  relapse biosignatures using automated methods based on passive monitoring. This  method may allow for earlier interventions, contribute to improve relapse prevention  and reduce symptoms interfering with recovery.

AB  - The objective of this study was to explore different stakeholder perspectives on the  MYPLAN app for suicide prevention safety planning. The study was a comparative  analysis of 4 focus groups with Danish MYPLAN stakeholders, young users, adult  users, relatives, and clinicians. The focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed,  and subjected to a thematic analysis. The analysis contextualized the participants'  experiences of the benefits and limitations of MYPLAN. While participants believed  that MYPLAN could potentially interrupt early stages of a suicidal process,  clinicians' involvement in safety planning was considered important. MYPLAN could  potentially give users a sense of increased personal control but learning how to  effectively safety plan was not perceived to be simple and additional support should  be considered for MYPLAN users.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this research were to develop and evaluate a cell  phone application based on the standard protocol for personal health devices and the  standard information model for personal health records to support effective blood  glucose management and standardized service for patients with diabetes. METHODS: An  application was developed for Android 4.0.3. In addition, an IEEE 11073 Manager,  Medical Device Encoding Rule, and Bluetooth Health Device Profile Connector were  developed for standardized health communication with a glucometer, and a Continuity  of Care Document (CCD) Composer and CCD Parser were developed for CCD document  exchange. The developed application was evaluated by five healthcare professionals  and 87 users through a questionnaire comprising the following variables: usage  intention, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating condition, perceived  risk, and voluntariness. RESULTS: As a result of the evaluation of usability, it was  confirmed that the developed application is useful for blood glucose self-monitoring  by diabetic patients. In particular, the healthcare professionals stated their own  views that the application is useful to observe the trends in blood glucose change  through the automatic function which records a blood glucose level measured using  Bluetooth function, and the function which checks accumulated records of blood  glucose levels. Also, a result of the evaluation of usage intention was 3.52 ± 0.42  out of 5 points. CONCLUSIONS: The application developed by our research team was  confirmed by the verification of healthcare professionals that accurate feedback can  be provided to healthcare professionals during the management of diabetic patients  or education for glucose management.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to study regional differences in Italy of quit smoking attempts and of  successful abstinence, in relation to socioeconomic status, cigarettes per day  (cig/die), and smoking cessation method in a representative sample of the population  resident in Italy. DESIGN: cross-sectional survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: in  2014-2017, PASSI survey (the ongoing Italian behavioural risk factor  surveillancesystem) gathered data on smoking and sociodemographic characteristics of  35,157 smokers; 13,130 aged 18-69 years made >1 quit attempt in the previous year,  1,176 of them were successful quitters for >6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:  proportion of smokers who tried to quit; proportion of smokers who successfully  quitted. RESULTS: about 35% of smokers made >1 quit attempt in the last year.  Northern Italians and smokers with many economic difficulties were more likely to  make a quit attempt, whereas heavy smokers were less likely. About 10% of attempters  were abstinent for >6 months: from 6% in Campania and Abruzzo to 17% in the Bolzano  province. Attempters who smoked <20 cig/die had higher likelihood to be abstinent,  compared to those smoking <20 cig/die. Attempters with many economic difficulties  had the lowest likelihood to be abstinent (7%), with no differences by region,  educational level, quitting method. Attempters with no economic difficulties  recorded the highest cessation rates (12%). Among them, those from Northern Italy,  Tuscany, Marche, and Lazio (Central Italy), and Apulia (Southern Italy) compared to  attempters from most Southern regions, and those with high education level or using  traditional quitting methods compared to those using electronic cigarettes or  unaided were more likely to be abstinent for >6 months. CONCLUSIONS: smokers with  many economic difficulties in all Italy, and those with no economic difficulties  residing in Umbria and in most Southern Italian regions, except for Basilicata and  Puglia, recorded lower chances to quit. Regional differences may have two possible  explanations integrating each other: Northern-Central regions are in a slightly more  advanced stage in the tobacco epidemic; regions which developed specific tobacco  control interventions in their Prevention Plans recorded higher quitting rates.  Not-yet-implemented interventions could promote smoking cessation in smokers from  Southern Italy and in those with lower socioeconomic status: reimbursement of  smoking cessation treatments, a well-developed national Quitline linked to a  webplatform and to mobile phone application or text-messaging, an opt-out smoking  cessation service offered systematically to all smokers at every encounter in  hospitals or health services.

T2  - Food and nutrition bulletin
AB  - BACKGROUND: Consumer nutrition environment measures are important to understanding  the food environment, which affects individual dietary intake. A nutrition  environment measures survey for supermarkets (NEMS-S) has been designed on paper for  use in Guatemala. However, a paper survey is not an inconspicuous data collection  method. OBJECTIVE: To design, pilot test, and validate the Guatemala NEMS-S in the  form of a mobile phone application (mobile app). METHODS: CommCare, a free and  open-source software application, was used to design the NEMS-S for Guatemala in the  form of a mobile app. Two raters tested the mobile app in a single Guatemalan  supermarket. Both the interrater and the test-retest reliability of the mobile app  were determined using percent agreement and Cohen's kappa score and compared with  the interrater and test-retest reliability of the paper version. RESULTS: Interrater  reliability was very high between the paper survey and the mobile app (Cohen's kappa  > 0.90). Test-retest reliability ranged from kappa 0.78 to 0.91. Between two  certified NEMS-S raters, survey completion time using the mobile app was 5 minutes  less than that with the paper form (35 vs. 40 minutes). CONCLUSIONS: The NEMS-S  mobile app provides for more rapid data collection, with equivalent reliability and  validity to the NEMS-S paper version, with advantages over a paper-based survey of  multiple language capability and concomitant data entry.

T2  - Pediatric neurology
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to describe the relationship between risk factors, such as  stress, depression, and anxiety, and potentially protective factors against  pediatric headache-related disability, such as mindfulness, resilience, and  self-compassion, and to determine teens' interest in mind-body skills training to  help reduce headache-related disability. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey  among adolescents seen in an academic neurology clinic reporting four or more  headaches monthly using standardized instruments to determine the relationship  between putative risk and protective factors as well as physiologic markers of  inflammation and vagal tone and headache-related disability. RESULTS: Among the 29  participants, 31% were male, the average age was 14.8 years, average headache  frequency was 11.6 per month, and the most commonly reported trigger was stress  (86%). The only risk or protective factor significantly associated with  headache-related disability was depression (r = 0.52, P = 0.004). Depression was  negatively correlated with mindfulness, resilience, and self-compassion (P < 0.01  each) and positively correlated with stress, sleep disturbance, and anxiety  (P < 0.01 each). Biomarkers of vagal tone and inflammation were correlated with each  other but not with headache-related disability or depression. There was strong  interest in learning skills like slow, deep breathing practices supported by a smart  phone application to reduce stress and the negative impact of headaches on daily  life. DISCUSSION: Among teens with frequent migraine headaches, depression is the  strongest risk factor for headache-related disability. Stress is viewed as a  headache trigger, and teens reported wanting to learn simple stress management  strategies supported by a smart phone application to help reduce headache-related  disability.

TI  - Trends and characteristics of enrolment in the National Health Insurance Scheme in  Ghana: a quantitative analysis of longitudinal data.
AU  - Nsiah-Boateng, Eric

T2  - Global health research and policy
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2004, Ghana started experimenting a National Health Insurance Scheme  (NHIS) to reduce  out-of-pocket payment for healthcare. Like many other social  health insurance schemes in Africa, the NHIS is striving for universal health  coverage (UHC). This paper examines trends and characteristics of enrolment in the  scheme to inform policy decisions on attainment of UHC. METHODS: We conducted trend  analysis of longitudinal enrolment data of the NHIS for the period, 2010-2017.  Descriptive statistics were used to examine trends and characteristics of enrolment  by geographical region and member groups. RESULTS: Over the 8-year period, the  population enrolled in the scheme increased from 33% (8.2 million) to 41% (11.3  million) between 2010 and 2015 and dropped to 35% (10.3 million) in 2017. Members  who renewed their membership increased from 44% to 75.4% between 2010 and 2013 and  then dropped to 73% in 2017. On average, the urban regions had significantly higher  number of new enrolments than the rural ones. Similarly, the urban and peri-urban  regions recorded significantly higher number of renewals than the other regions. In  addition, persons below the age of 18 years and the informal sector workers had  significantly higher number of enrolment than any other member group. CONCLUSIONS:  Enrolment in the NHIS is declining and there are significant differences among  geographical regions and member groups. Managers of the NHIS need to enforce the  mandatory enrolment provision in the Act governing the scheme, employ innovative  strategies such as mobile phone application for registration and renewals and  address delays in healthcare provider claims to improve enrolment.

AB  - Intrusive thoughts, images, and their appraisal remain difficult to study despite  their clinical relevance. Clinical studies typically used time-based (frequency and  distress per observation period), while analogue studies mainly used event-based  (report upon occurrence) assessment. A comparison of intrusion frequency, distress  appraisal, compliance, and reactivity across different assessments is mostly  lacking, particularly with regard to analogue research. Here, intrusions were  induced via aversive films and assessed by a smart phone application for 4 days.  Three sampling modes were compared by randomizing participants to one of three  conditions: either one, or five time-based daily prompts, or event-based assessment.  At the end of the study, all participants reported intrusions once again in a  retrospective summary assessment. Results indicate that intrusions and their  distress decayed over a few days. The three assessments did not differ in intrusion  frequency, distress appraisal, compliance (generally high), reactivity (generally  low), or retrospective summary assessment. Across groups, the more aversive and  arousing participants rated the film clips and the more reactivity to the  electronic-diary assessment they reported, the more intrusive memories they had;  assessment modes did not differ on this. Thus, no general differences were found  between electronic-diary assessment modes for analogue intrusions, giving  researchers flexibility for tailoring ecological momentary assessment to specific  study aims.

AB  - Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the supportive tissues and bone  surrounding the teeth. In severe cases, it can consequently lead to tooth loss. This  disease is most prevalent in rural and remote communities where regular dental  visits are limited. Hence, there's a need for a periodontal screening tool for use  by allied health professionals outside of dental clinics to detect periodontitis for  early referral and intervention. In this paper two algorithms have been proposed and  applied on two independently collected datasets in Germany and Australia with 20 and  24 participating subjects respectively; in the first algorithm, intra-oral images of  before periodontitis treatment have been considered as diseased subjects and the  images of after treatment have been considered as healthy subjects. Using the  histogram of pixel intensity as our classification feature, the healthy and diseased  subjects have been classified with an accuracy of 66.7%. In the second algorithm,  using the difference between the histograms as our classification features, images  of "before" and "after" treatment have been classified with an accuracy of 91.6%. If  used in a smart phone application, the first algorithm can help people with limited  access to dental clinics to be screened for periodontitis by allied health  professionals in any healthcare setting. The second algorithm may be useful in  helping non-dental personnel to monitor the progress of periodontal treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Walking speed has been associated with many clinical outcomes (e.g.,  frailty, mortality, joint replacement need, etc.). Accurately measuring walking  speed (stride length x step count/time) typically requires significant  clinician/staff time or a gait lab with specialized equipment (i.e., electronic  timers or motion capture). In the present study, our goal was to measure "step  count" via smartphones through novel software and to compare with step tracking  software that come standard with iOS and Android smartphones as a first step in  walking speed measurement. METHODS: A separate calibration and validation data  collection was performed. Individuals in the calibration collection (n = 5) walked  20m at normal and slow speed (<1.0 m/s). Appropriate settings for the novel mobile  application were chosen to measure step count. Individuals in the validation (n =  52) collection walked at 6m, 10m, and 20m at normal and slow walking speeds. We  compared step difference (absolute difference) from observed step counts to native  step tracking software and our novel software derived step counts. We used  generalized estimated equation adjusted (participant level) negative binomial  regression models of absolute step difference from observed step counts, to  determine optimal settings (calibration) and subsequently to gauge performance of  the shake algorithm settings and native step tracking software across different  distances and speeds (validation). RESULTS: For iOS/iPhone 6, when compared to  observed step count, the shake service (software driven approach) significantly  outperformed the embedded native step tracking software across all distances at slow  speed, and for short distance (6m) at normal speed. On the Android phone, the shake  service outperformed the native step tracking software at slow speed at 6 meters and  20 meters, while its performance eclipsed the native step tracking software only at  20 meters at normal speed. DISCUSSION: Our software based approach outperformed  native step tracking software across various speeds and distances and carries the  advantage of having adjustable measurement parameters that can be further optimized  for specific medical conditions. Such software applications will provide an  effective way to capture standardized data across multiple commercial smartphone  devices, facilitating the future capture of walking speed and other clinically  important performance parameters that will influence clinical and home care in the  era of value based care.

T2  - Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners
AB  - PURPOSE: Asthma burden affects mortality, morbidity, quality of life, and the  economy. Written asthma action plans are standard of care according to national  guidelines, but these plans are often not prescribed. The purpose of this project  was to develop an asthma action plan application for smartphones. DATA SOURCES: A  development studio was consulted for support in developing a smartphone application  to code the software for the asthma action plan and assist in the design process.  During development of the application, a survey was conducted to assist in design of  the application and functionality. CONCLUSIONS: All survey participants agreed that  the application was easy to use, could be used without written instruction, and was  designed for adolescents with asthma of any severity. Patients and providers mostly  agreed that the app would help provide information about what to do in the event of  an asthma exacerbation, and the application would be used frequently. IMPLICATIONS  FOR PRACTICE: There was consensus from both patients and providers that this  application is not only functional but also helpful in the event of an asthma  exacerbation. The project met the goal of designing a mobile phone application that  would improve patient access to asthma action plans.

AB  - The nature of the road environment requires drivers to be vigilant and attentive.  Distracted driving is a primary concern, as it threatens the safety of road users.  However very little research has been conducted into interventions to combat such an  issue. Existing interventions such as police enforcement and legislation appear to  have limited effect. The use of mobile phone applications to assist in limiting  driver distraction is an alternative intervention that is currently gaining  traction. With a great array of potential benefits, such as reducing road toll,  these applications can be readily available to all road users. Despite the positive  implications, it is vital that drivers accept the use of such a technology for the  intervention to be effective. Therefore, understanding driver acceptance is an  important step in implanting such applications. To assess this, the present study  examines the utility of two versions of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the  Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of  Technology (UTAUT) for understanding the acceptance of technology designed to reduce  distraction. Participants were presented with two different applications and  responded to questions that indicated their attitudes towards the factors included  in the TAM, TPB and UTAUT, alongside their intent to use the technology. A total of  731 participants responded to the survey, and their responses analysed. The results  indicated that overall, Davis' (1985) TAM was slightly better in explaining  behavioural intent for both Mobile Phone Application (MPA) 1 and MPA 2, explaining  66.1% and 68.7% of the variance, respectively. Davis' (1989) TAM and the TPB were  close behind, while the UTAUT explained the least variance in behavioural intent of  all the models. Overall, the findings of this study provide support for using  psychological theories to assess the acceptance of mobile phone applications.

AU  - Hussain, I.

T2  - The Review of scientific instruments
AB  - A 3D printed smartphone based interferometric system is proposed, and its usability  has been demonstrated by measuring small angular rotations. All necessary fringe  processing and data analysis have been performed within the phone itself using  custom designed application developed in an android platform. The main objective of  the proposed work is to demonstrate the usability of modern smartphone and 3D  printing technology for optical interferometric applications. The smartphone camera  has been used to record the interference fringes which has been formed due to the  change in the optical path difference (OPD) between light rays reflected from the  top and bottom surface of a microscopic glass slide. The angular variation of the  slide causes a detectable change in the OPD between the interfering beams which  subsequently would cause a variation in the fringe pattern. By evaluating necessary  interferometric parameters, small angular rotation can be computed within the  smartphone application. With the designed smartphone based interferometric system,  angular rotation as small as 0.02° can be measured accurately and reliably having a  dynamic range of -3.68° to 3.68°. Due to the involvement of the smartphone as a  platform for recording as well as onboard fringe processing, the designed  interferometric system can be visualized as a truly field portable tool for  different optical metrological applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind  study, we investigated the impact of a mobile patient engagement application on  health outcomes and quality of life in allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma patients.  METHODS: In total, 327 patients with diagnoses of persistent AR or mild-to-severe  persistent asthma were randomized into 2 intervention groups and 2 control groups  upon their admission at outpatient clinics. The intervention groups (POPET-AR and  POPET-Asthma) received a mobile phone application ("physician on call patient  engagement trial" [POPET]), enabling them to communicate with their physician, and  record their health status and medication compliance. The AR groups completed the  Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) at initiation and at the first month  of the study. The asthma groups completed the Asthma Control Test (ACT) at  initiation and at the third month of the study. RESULTS: The POPET-AR group showed  better clinical improvement than the control group in terms of the overall RQLQ  score as well in measures of general problems, activity, symptoms other than  nose/eye, and emotion domains (p < 0.05). In the POPET-Asthma group, more patients  (49%) achieved a well-controlled asthma score (ACT > 19) compared with the control  group (27%); this was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Use of a  mobile engagement platform, such as POPET, can have a significant impact on health  outcomes and quality of life in both AR and asthma, potentially decreasing the  number of hospital admissions, repeat doctor visits, and losses in productivity.  Improvements were seen in domains related to activity, productivity, perception of  disease, and emotion.

AB  - Advances in the area of mobile and wireless communication for healthcare (m-Health)  along with the improvements in information science allow the design and development  of new patient-centric models for the provision of personalised healthcare services,  increase of patient independence and improvement of patient's self-control and  self-management capabilities. This paper comprises a brief overview of the m-Health  applications towards the self-management of individuals with diabetes mellitus and  the enhancement of their quality of life. Furthermore, the design and development of  a mobile phone application for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) self-management is  presented. The technical evaluation of the application, which permits the management  of blood glucose measurements, blood pressure measurements, insulin dosage,  food/drink intake and physical activity, has shown that the use of the mobile phone  technologies along with data analysis methods might improve the self-management of  T1DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational age (GA) is a key determinant of newborn survival and  long-term impairment. Accurate estimation of GA facilitates timely provision of  essential interventions to improve maternal and newborn outcomes. Menstrual based  dating, ultrasound based dating, and neonatal estimates are the primarily used  methods for assessing GA; all of which have some strength and weaknesses that  require critical consideration. Last menstrual period (LMP) is simple, low-cost  self-reported information, recommended by the World Health Organization for  estimating GA but has issues of recall mainly among poorer, less educated women and  women with irregular menstruation, undiagnosed abortion, and spotting during early  pregnancy. Several studies have noted that about 20-50% of women cannot accurately  recall the date of LMP. The goal of this study is therefore to improve recall and  reporting of LMP and by doing so increase the accuracy of LMP based GA assessment in  a rural population of Bangladesh where antenatal care-seeking, availability and  utilization of USG is low. METHOD: We propose to conduct a 4- parallel arm,  superiority, community based cluster randomized controlled trial comparing three  interventions to improve recall of GA with a no intervention arm. The interventions  include (i) counselling and a paper based calendar (ii) counselling and a cell phone  based SMS alert system (iii) counselling and smart-phone application. The trial is  being conducted among 3360 adolescent girls and recently married women in Mirzapur  sub-district of Bangladesh. DISCUSSION: Enrolment of study participants continued  from January 24, 2017 to March 29, 2017. Data collection and intervention  implementation is ongoing and will end by February, 2019. Data analysis will measure  efficacy of interventions in improving the recall of LMP date among enrolled  participants. Results will be reported following CONSORT guideline. The innovative  conventional & e-platform based interventions, if successful, can provide  substantial evidence to scale-up in a low resource setting where m-Health  initiatives are proliferating with active support from all sectors in policy and  implementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02944747 . The trial has  been registered before starting enrolment on 24 October 2016.

AB  - This article describes a study protocol, which aims to explore and describe the  feasibility of a mobile-phone application for initiating intuitive eating and  intuitive exercising in patients who are following an ambulatory treatment for  obesity. Intuitive eating refers to one's ability to make food choices based on  one's awareness of his/her body's response. Intuitive exercising encourages people  in finding enjoyable ways of being physically active. These two components will be  trained using an implementation intention procedure, that is, behavioral plans that  aim at creating a strong link between a specified situation and a response. We aim  to recruit up to 80 overweight and obese patients over a period of 2 years. The  smartphone application will be assessed on the basis of (i) data obtained through a  4-week use period, (ii) self-report measures taken before and after the use of the  mobile application, and (iii) feedbacks from participants after the use of the  mobile application. This pilot study will allow us to better understand the  applicability of the use of mobile application within ambulatory treatment settings,  and to adapt the design of the app necessary for building cross-sectional studies  investigating its efficacy.

AB  - Emerging evidence links poor sleep health with a range of adverse health behaviors,  including condomless anal intercourse (CAI) among men who have sex with men (MSM).  We tested associations between a range of sleep health indicators and sex outcomes  in an online sample of 559 MSM in Paris France, recruited from a  geosocial-networking phone application. Participants reported on sleep quality,  sleep duration, problems falling asleep, and problems staying awake during wake-time  activities, and four sex outcomes: numbers of receptive, insertive, and total CAI  partners in the past three months, and use of substances before or during sex. In  bivariate analyses, all four sleep variables were associated with the three CAI  outcomes, whereas poor sleep quality and problems falling asleep were positively  associated with using substances before or during sex. Most of these associations  remained significant when adjusting for various socio-demographic and behavioral  covariates. These findings highlight the importance of addressing sleep health to  prevent HIV risk among MSM.

T2  - International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with respiratory diseases are more prone to health risks of air  travel. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the current knowledge and  attitudes of Turkish pulmonary physicians for air travel in patients with chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was  developed and administered either by congress mobile phone application or by e-mail.  A total of 242 physicians participated in the study (75 by mobile phone application  and 167 through the e-mail). RESULTS: Among participants, only 30.6% reported that  they usually inform COPD patients about possible risks of air travel in their  routine practice. A preflight assessment was performed by 61.2% of them and a fit to  fly report was prepared by 34.3%. The most common methods/tests used for preflight  assessment were reported as oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry, arterial blood  gas analysis, and pulmonary function tests (51.2%, 50.8%, and 49.6%, respectively).  When the participants were asked to plan safe air travel in two clinical case  scenarios, only 16.2% were able to answer both cases correctly. CONCLUSION: This  study shows that a standard approach for preflight assessment in patients with COPD  is lacking and an active initiative is needed to increase awareness and education  for fit to fly concept for COPD among pulmonologists.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of literature outlining the promise of mobile  information and communication technologies to improve healthcare in  resource-constrained contexts. METHODS: We reviewed the literature related to mobile  information and communication technologies which aim to improve healthcare in  resource-constrained contexts, in order to glean general observations regarding the  state of mHealth in high-income countries (HIC) and low- and middle-income countries  (LMIC). RESULTS: mHealth interventions in LMIC often differ substantively from those  in HIC, with the former being simpler, delivered through a single digital component  (an SMS as opposed to a mobile phone application, or 'app'), and, as a result,  targeting only one of the many factors which impact on the activation (or  deactivation) of the target behaviour. Almost as a rule, LMIC mHealth interventions  lack an explicit theory of change. CONCLUSION: We highlight the necessity, when  designing mHealth interventions, of having a theory of change that encompasses  multiple salient perspectives pertaining to human behaviour. To address this need,  we explore whether the concept of Life History Strategy could provide the mHealth  field with a useful theory of change. Life History Strategy Theory may be  particularly useful in understanding some of the problems, paradoxes, and  limitations of mHealth interventions found in LMIC. Specifically, this theory  illuminates questions regarding 'light-weight' programmes which solely provide  information, reminders, and other virtual 'nudges' that may have limited impact on  behaviours governed by extrinsic structural factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Balance assessment and training is utilized by clinicians and their  patients to measure and improve balance. There is, however, little consistency in  terms of how clinicians, researchers, and patients measure standing balance.  Utilizing the inherent sensors in every smartphone, a mobile application was  developed to provide a method of objectively measuring standing balance. OBJECTIVE:  We aimed to determine if a mobile phone application, which utilizes the phone's  accelerometer, can quantify standing balance. METHODS: Three smartphones were  positioned simultaneously above the participants' malleolus and patella and at the  level of the umbilicus. Once secured, the myAnkle application was initiated to  measure acceleration. Forty-eight participants completed 8 different balance  exercises separately for the right and left legs. Accelerometer readings were  obtained from each mobile phone and mean acceleration was calculated for each  exercise at each ankle and knee and the torso. RESULTS: Mean acceleration vector  magnitude was reciprocally transformed to address skewness in the data distribution.  Repeated measures ANOVAs were completed using the transformed data. A significant  2-way interaction was revealed between exercise condition and the body position of  the phone (P<.001). Post-hoc tests indicated higher acceleration vector magnitude  for exercises of greater difficulty. ANOVAs at each body position were conducted to  examine the effect of exercise. The results revealed the knee as the location most  sensitive for the detection of differences in acceleration between exercises. The  accelerometer ranking of exercise difficulty showed high agreement with expert  clinical rater rankings (kappa statistic>0.9). CONCLUSIONS: The myAnkle application  revealed significantly greater acceleration magnitude for exercises of greater  difficulty. Positioning of the mobile phone at the knee proved to be the most  sensitive to changes in accelerometer values due to exercise difficulty. Application  validity was shown through comparison with clinical raters. As such, the myAnkle app  has utility as a measurement tool for standing balance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Smart phones are becoming ubiquitous and their computing capabilities  are ever increasing. Consequently, more attention is geared toward their potential  use in research and medical settings. For instance, their built-in hardware can  provide quantitative data for different movements. Therefore, the goal of the  current study was to evaluate the capabilities of a standalone smart phone platform  to characterize tremor. RESULTS: Algorithms for tremor recording and online analysis  can be implemented within a smart phone. The smart phone provides reliable time- and  frequency-domain tremor characteristics. The smart phone can also provide medically  relevant tremor assessments. DISCUSSION: Smart phones have the potential to provide  researchers and clinicians with quantitative short- and long-term tremor assessments  that are currently not easily available. METHODS: A smart phone application for  tremor quantification and online analysis was developed. Then, smart phone results  were compared to those obtained simultaneously with a laboratory accelerometer.  Finally, results from the smart phone were compared to clinical tremor assessments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Unintended pregnancies can result in poorer health outcomes for women,  children and families. Young people in low and middle income countries are at  particular risk of unintended pregnancies and could benefit from innovative  contraceptive interventions. There is growing evidence that interventions delivered  by mobile phone can be effective in improving a range of health behaviours. This  paper describes the development of a contraceptive behavioural intervention  delivered by mobile phone for young people in Tajikistan, Bolivia and Palestine,  where unmet need for contraception is high among this group. METHODS: Guided by  Intervention Mapping, the following steps contributed to the development of the  interventions: (1) needs assessment; (2) specifying behavioural change to result  from the intervention; (3) selecting behaviour change methods to include in the  intervention; (4) producing and refining the intervention content. RESULTS: The  results of the needs assessment produced similar interventions across the countries.  The interventions consist of short daily messages delivered over 4 months (delivered  by text messaging in Palestine and mobile phone application instant messages in  Bolivia and Tajikistan). The messages provide information about contraception,  target attitudes that are barriers to contraceptive uptake and support young people  in feeling that they can influence their reproductive health. The interventions each  contain the same ten behaviour change methods, adapted for delivery by mobile phone.  CONCLUSIONS: The development resulted in a well-specified, theory-based  intervention, tailored to each country. It is feasible to develop an intervention  delivered by mobile phone for young people in resource-limited settings.

AB  - The D+Wound Solution is a mobile phone application (app) that assists users in the  assessment and treatment of the wound. The app has 6 components for assessment: need  for debridement, infection control, revascularization, and exudate control; whether  it is chronic; and finally, the top surface of the skin. These components are named  D.I.R.E.C.T. The app makes you review these components as an algorithm to provide a  reasonable solution for dressing. It is designed to understand the status of the  wound and provide a practical treatment idea for wound care providers. A total of  118 nurses were divided into 2 groups, designated as experienced and  less-experienced groups, and surveyed. Both groups found the app to be helpful in  making a treatment plan. However, the less-experienced group found it to be  significantly more useful in assessing the wound ( P = .026) but difficult to  understand the logic. The experienced group found the logic to be significantly  easier to understand ( P = .018) and had significantly higher similarities ( P =  .015) in treatment protocols compared with the less-experienced group. We may  conclude that this app has a logical algorithm resembling experienced wound  caregivers and is more useful in the less-experienced group.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Measuring fecal calprotectin (FC) in a laboratory is time-consuming and  that is why home tests have been developed. We studied the use of an FC home test in  pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) in real-life settings.  METHODS: The patients were asked to perform the IBDoc FC home test monthly for 6  months and to report their clinical disease activity at testing. Clinical  decision-making, however, was guided by routine FC enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  (ELISA) for patients with raised IBDoc values. Spare frozen samples were analyzed  using ELISA and IBDoc in the laboratory. The participants completed a questionnaire  about FC testing at the start and end of the study. RESULTS: Of the 52 patients, 35  (67%) ages 5 to 18 years completed the study, and 197 home tests were performed. Of  these, 15% failed, mainly because of technical reasons. Just under half of the  patients (47%) considered home testing comparable or superior to routine testing. In  contrast, the parents were unsatisfied (61%), mostly because the IBDoc results were  significantly different from ELISA and they found the phone application difficult to  handle but whenever the IBDoc was performed by a laboratory professional it was  comparable with ELISA, suggesting that practical issues hampered home testing.  Despite their reservations, more than 80% of parents felt that home testing would  improve disease management. CONCLUSIONS: PIBD patients and their families were  interested in FC home monitoring and willing to adopt testing as a part of their  disease management, but this approach requires thorough guidance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Wireless and mobile phone technology as a method of data collection will  increase alongside conventional methods. The aim of the present study was to  evaluate the use of a mobile phone application for recording symptoms and physical  activity exertion during an experimental physical exercise study. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: An experimental study on the effects of physical exercise on the well-being  of menopausal women included 158 subjects between 44 and 63 years of age. The women  were randomized into intervention and control groups. All participants in both  groups reported daily symptoms by responding to morning and evening questionnaires  via mobile phones. The usability of the mobile phone as a data collector tool was  evaluated with the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire 2 months after the  intervention. The feasibility evaluation was based on the frequency of responses and  open questions. RESULTS: The response rates were about 70% to both morning and  evening questionnaires. The average frequency of responses (n =158) to morning  questionnaires was 125 (±40)/170 (±14) and to evening questionnaires was 118  (±40)/171 (±14). The response rate did not differ between the intervention and the  control groups. The SUS score was on average 75.4 (range, 0-100; n =107).  CONCLUSION: A mobile phone diary is a feasible and usable tool for data collection  in clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is characterized by bone fragility, and  features such as blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta, hearing loss, ligamentous  laxity and short stature can be present. It has long been assumed that the  functional ability and quality of life of patients with OI depends primarily on the  severity of skeletal deformities. However, fatigue is often mentioned in clinic by  patients with all types of OI as an important modifier of their quality of life and  does not always seem to be related to their functional ability. The aim of this  study is to investigate whether adults with Osteogenesis Imperfecta are  significantly more fatigued than the normal population. METHODS: The Fatigue  Severity Scale (FSS) was distributed by mobile phone application among 151 adult  patients with different OI types. Results of the FSS in the OI group were compared  with two control populations from America (n = 20) and the Netherlands (n = 113).  RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients (OI type 1 (n = 72), OI type 3 (n = 13), OI type 4  (n = 14) completed the FSS questionnaire. The mean FSS score of this cohort was 4.4  and significantly higher than the control populations (2.3/2.9). 65% of our cohort  reported at least moderate fatigue compared with 2 control populations from America  and the Netherlands. CONCLUSION: Fatigue in patients with OI is a frequently  encountered problem in our expert clinic but research into this topic is sparse.  This pilot study is the largest study to date investigating fatigue in patients with  OI and results have been compared with two control groups. The mean FSS score of 4.4  in the OI group indicates that people with OI are generally significantly more  fatigued than the control population. Further evaluation of fatigue and its  influencers in a larger group of OI patients is important for future management.

T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
AB  - Asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) were used extensively throughout much of the  20th century and can still be found in many Australian homes. Therefore, we  developed a mobile application ("app"), called ACM Check, which guides users through  a home inspection to identify and assess certain types of in situ ACM. A  cross-sectional study was conducted using the app to collect data on the type and  condition of in situ asbestos in Australian residential settings. Since being  released in June 2017, we have received data for 702 home inspections. Of these, 578  (82.3%) houses contained a total of 1895 in situ materials categorised as positive  for asbestos by the app. The most prevalent ACMs were used for the backing board to  electrical meter boxes (50% of homes), eaves and soffit linings (44.2% of homes),  and fencing (28.1% of homes). While the majority of ACMs were categorised as 'very  low' or 'low' priority for removal or remediation, 6.6% of all ACMs were considered  to be of 'high' priority. Mobile apps offer a platform to help increase people's  awareness of possible health hazards found in the residential environment, such as  asbestos, while also being used to collect data for public and environmental health  research.

AB  - RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Day surgery is evolving, with a majority of  recoveries occurring at home. There is, in parallel, an evolution in telemedical  technology. The aim of the present project was to identify patients' willingness to  use predefined follow-up techniques and to clinically test preferred techniques at  home using a two-step study.┅ METHODS: In Part I, a paper-based questionnaire study  of identified patients' attitudes with three follow-up techniques was used. In Part  II, a feasibility test of a mobile (smart-phone) application for follow-up at home  was used. RESULTS: Part I showed overall positive attitudes to telemedical  follow-ups. Part II showed the preference for a follow-up technique with a mobile  application was not fully consistent with the clinical study of the smart-phone app,  where there was a large non-response. The application provided safe transfer of data  to the hospital and helped make it easy to retrieve and analyse patient  self-assessment of recovery. This application is one-way directed, and no feedback  to the patient was given, which may have influenced the non-response. CONCLUSION:  Bringing telemedicine into follow-up after surgery/anaesthesia is requested, and  furthermore, the feasibility study on day surgery presented here shows that it is  technically easy to perform and will provide robust information. It should be noted  that further studies are needed in order to find better patient cooperation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients undergoing anaesthesia and surgery experience  postoperative complications. Our aim was to investigate whether a systematic  follow-up smartphone-based assessment, using recovery assessment by phone points  (RAPP) compared with standard care, had a positive effect on day surgery patients'  postoperative recovery. We also investigated whether there were differences in women  and men's recovery and recovery scores. METHODS: The study was a single-blind,  multicentre randomized controlled trial. A total of 997 patients were randomly  allocated to either RAPP or standard care. The Swedish web version of a quality of  recovery (SwQoR) questionnaire was used to evaluate the patients' postoperative  recovery, either on paper or using an application (RAPP) on postoperative days seven  and 14. RESULTS: On postoperative day seven the RAPP group reported significantly  better values in seven out of 24 items of the SwQoR: sleeping difficulties; not  having a general feeling of wellbeing; having difficulty feeling  relaxed/comfortable; and dizziness; headache; pain in the surgical wound; and a  swollen surgical wound compared with the control group, implying a good  postoperative recovery. Both men and women in the RAPP group reported significantly  better values (and, hence good postoperative recovery) compared with the control  group in the items sleeping difficulties; not having a general feeling of wellbeing  and pain in the surgical wound. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of patient-reported  outcomes using a smartphone-based application was associated with decreased  discomfort from several postoperative symptoms. Systematic e-assessment can thereby  increase patients' quality of recovery and identify key areas for improvement in  perioperative care. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02492191.

AB  - Management of postoperative pain is a challenge for healthcare providers in all  surgical fields, especially in the context of the current opioid epidemic. We  developed a cell phone application to monitor pain, medication use, and relevant  quality of life domains (eg, mood, mobility, return to work, and sleep) in patients  with neurogenic pain, including those with limb loss. A literature review was  conducted to define application length and design parameters. The final application  includes 12 questions for patients with limb loss and 8 for patients with neurogenic  pain without limb loss. Pilot testing with 21 participants demonstrates acceptable  time to complete the application (mean = 158 seconds, SD = 81 seconds) and  usability, based on the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire. We aim for our  application to serve as an outcome measure for evaluation of an evolving group of  peripheral nerve procedures, including targeted muscle reinnervation. In addition,  the application could be adapted for clinical use in patients undergoing these  procedures for neurogenic pain and thus serve as a tool to monitor and manage pain  medication use.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vitamin E is one of the most promising agents for nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis (NASH) treatment, and its drug responsiveness may be closely  associated with haptoglobin (Hp) genotype. However, its efficacy and safety remain  unknown in China. This clinical trial of vitamin E versus placebo for the treatment  of nondiabetic patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (VENS) is conducted to  evaluate (a) the efficacy and safety of treatment with vitamin E softgel  (300 mg/day) determined from standardized histologic scoring of liver biopsies, (b)  whether treatment with vitamin E improves biochemical parameters, cytokines,  anthropometric parameters, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and transient  elastography (TE) values determined by Fibroscan and health-related quality of life  (SF-36), (c) whether the efficacy of vitamin E treatment is associated with the Hp  genotype in nondiabetic adults with NASH. METHODS: VENS is a multicenter,  randomized, double-masked, placebo parallel controlled trial to evaluate the  efficacy and safety of treatment with vitamin E softgel in nondiabetic adults with  NASH versus treatment with placebo in China. Liver biopsies are read by a  pathological evaluation committee independently according to the NASH Clinical  Research Network (CRN) scoring system. The NAFLD activity score (NAS) represents the  sum of scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning. The  definition of histologic improvement requires all three of the following criteria to  be met: (a) either improvement in NAS by at least 2 points or post-treatment NAS  score no higher than 3, (b) at least 1-point improvement in the score for  ballooning, and (c) no worsening of fibrosis stages. We plan to recruit 120  biopsy-proven NASH patients from13 centers in China. Participants will be randomly  assigned to groups treated with either with vitamin E (100 mg, tid) or placebo for  96 weeks then followed by 24 weeks of post-treatment observation. Biochemical  parameters, cytokines, anthropometric parameters, CAP and TE values, Hp genotype,  and several questionnaires will be collected as per the schedule. This protocol was  approved by the Ethics Committee of Hangzhou Normal University Affiliated Hospital  to ensure patients safety, and R&G Pharmastudies Co., Ltd. was established for  monitoring the accumulated interim data to review efficacy and quality of data  collection and overall study management. RESULTS: As a preliminary study, a mobile  phone application (app) for lifestyle modification and database recording (  http://laiyivens.365hy.com ) was exploited for every participant. The percentage of  NAFLD patients with Hp 2-2 allele is much higher than that of Western patients  (65.71% vs 36%, respectively), which suggests that the Chinese benefit more from  vitamin E treatment. CONCLUSION: VENS is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT)  to evaluate the efficacy of Vitamin E in treating nondiabetic NASH patients in  China.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy is hazardous for  both mother and foetus. Better asthma control may be achieved if patients are  involved in regular self-monitoring of symptoms and self-management according to a  written asthma action plan. Telehealth applications to optimize asthma management  and outcomes in pregnant women have not yet been evaluated. This study evaluated the  efficacy of a telehealth programme supported by a handheld respiratory device in  improving asthma control during pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women with asthma  (n = 72) from two antenatal clinics in Melbourne, Australia, were randomized to one  of two groups: (i) intervention-involving a telehealth programme (management of  asthma with supportive telehealth of respiratory function in pregnancy (MASTERY(©)  )) supported by a handheld respiratory device and an Android smart phone application  (Breathe-easy(©) ) and written asthma action plan or (ii) control-usual care. The  primary outcome was change in asthma control at 3 and 6 months (prenatal). Secondary  outcomes included changes in quality of life and lung function, and  perinatal/neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: At baseline, participants' mean (± standard  deviation) age was 31.4 ± 4.5 years and gestational age 16.7 ± 3.1 weeks. At  6 months, the MASTERY group had better asthma control (P = 0.02) and asthma-related  quality of life (P = 0.002) compared with usual care. There were no significant  differences between groups in lung function, unscheduled health-care visits, days  off work/study, oral corticosteroid use, or perinatal outcomes. Differences between  groups were not significant at 3 months. CONCLUSION: Telehealth interventions  supporting self-management are feasible and could potentially improve asthma control  and asthma-related quality of life during pregnancy.

METHODS: A prospective pilot study was conducted with a convenience  sample (n = 34) of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis using a  phone application, FatigueApp.com, to collect data on patient-reported outcome  measures (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS]).  RESULTS: FatigueApp feasibility was good, with the ability to collect data on  self-reported fatigue and other symptoms using PROMIS measures. CONCLUSIONS: This  study showed that using a phone application with PROMIS may be useful in the future  to provide estimates of fatigue and other variables to facilitate clinical  monitoring of fatigue for neurology clinic settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 11,000 people die in Scotland each year as a result of  smoking-related causes. Quitting smoking is relatively easy; maintaining a quit  attempt is a very difficult task with success rates for unaided quit attempts  stubbornly remaining in the single digits. Pharmaceutical treatment can improve  these rates by lowering the overall reward factor of nicotine. However, these and  related nicotine replacement therapies do not operate on, or address, the spatial  and contextual aspects of smoking behaviour. With the ubiquity of smartphones that  can log spatial, quantitative and qualitative data related to smoking behaviour,  there exists a person-centred clinical opportunity to support smokers attempting to  quit by first understanding their smoking behaviour and subsequently sending them  dynamic messages to encourage health behaviour change within a situational context.  METHODS: We have built a smartphone app-MapMySmoke-that works on Android and iOS  platforms. The deployment of this app within a clinical National Health Service  (NHS) setting has two distinct phases: (1) a 2-week logging phase where pre-quit  patients log all of their smoking and craving events; and (2) a post-quit phase  where users receive dynamic support messages and can continue to log craving events,  and should they occur, relapse events. Following the initial logging phase, patients  consult with their general practitioner (GP) or healthcare provider to review their  smoking patterns and to outline a precise, individualised quit attempt plan. Our  feasibility study consists of assessment of an initial app version during and after  use by eight patients recruited from an NHS Fife GP practice. In addition to  evaluation of the app as a potential smoking cessation aid, we have assessed the  user experience, technological requirements and security of the data flow. RESULTS:  In an initial feasibility study, we have deployed the app for a small number of  patients within one GP practice in NHS Fife. We recruited eight patients within one  surgery, four of whom actively logged information about their smoking behaviour.  Initial feedback was very positive, and users indicated a willingness to log their  craving and smoking events. In addition, two out of three patients who completed  follow-up interviews noted that the app helped them reduce the number of cigarettes  they smoked per day, while the third indicated that it had helped them quit. The  study highlighted the use of pushed notifications as a potential technology for  maintaining quit attempts, and the security of collection of data was audited. These  initial results influenced the design of a planned second larger study, comprised of  100 patients, the primary objectives of which are to use statistical modelling to  identify times and places of probable switches into smoking states, and to target  these times with dynamic health behaviour messaging. CONCLUSIONS: While the health  benefits of quitting smoking are unequivocal, such behaviour change is very  difficult to achieve. Many factors are likely to contribute to maintaining smoking  behaviour, yet the precise role of cues derived from the spatial environment remains  unclear. The rise of smartphones, therefore, allows clinicians the opportunity to  better understand the spatial aspects of smoking behaviour and affords them the  opportunity to push targeted individualised health support messages at vulnerable  times and places.

AB  - Professional organizations provide surveillance guidelines for BRCA1 and BRCA2  (BRCA) carriers with intact breasts and/or ovaries to facilitate early cancer  detection. However, literature indicates adherence to surveillance guidelines is  inconsistent at best. Using the Messaging Model for Health Communication Campaigns  framework, we undertook a two-phase formative research approach to develop an  intervention to promote adherence to surveillance guidelines. Discussion groups  identified preferred intervention format and function in phase I. Findings indicated  carriers desired a phone application (app) to assist with surveillance management  and appointment tracking. Thus, an iPhone app for carriers to track appointments  based on published surveillance guidelines was developed. In phase II, we obtained  feedback from BRCA carriers via a survey during a prototype demonstration at a  regional conference. Participants in phase II wanted reminder capabilities and the  ability to add and modify information fields. This feedback informed intervention  modifications, resulting in the Scheduling Necessary Advised Procedures (SNAP)  iPhone app currently being pilot tested by BRCA carriers throughout the USA.

AB  - Background: Depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance are common problems that  greatly affect quality of life for many myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients.  App-based mindfulness meditation is a feasible nonpharmacologic approach for  managing symptoms. However, previous research has not considered how patients'  overall mental health may influence their responsiveness to these interventions.  Objective: The purpose of this study was to conduct an exploratory, secondary  analysis of the effects of a smartphone meditation app, Calm, on depression,  anxiety, and sleep disturbance in MPN patients based on patients' baseline levels of  Global Mental Health (GMH). Methods: Participants (N = 80) were a subset of MPN  patients from a larger feasibility study. Patients were enrolled into an  intervention (use Calm for 10 minutes daily for 4 weeks) or educational control  group. Results: In multilevel models, there were significant 3-way interactions  between time, group, and baseline GMH for depression and anxiety symptoms, with  participants in the meditation intervention who reported the poorest baseline GMH  experiencing the greatest reduction in symptoms over time. For both intervention and  control participants, poorer initial GMH was associated with increases in sleep  disturbance symptoms over time. Conclusions: Mindfulness meditation apps, such as  Calm, may be effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in MPN patients,  particularly for those experiencing mental health difficulties. Given the need for  accessible tools to self-manage chronic cancer-related symptoms, especially strong  negative emotions, these findings warrant larger efficacy studies to determine the  effects of app-based meditation for alleviating depression and anxiety in cancer  populations.

AB  - Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) have been widely used as reporters in  colorimetric assays targeting nucleic acids. CPEs provide naked eye detection  possibility by their superior optical properties however, as concentration of target  analytes decrease, trace amounts of nucleic acid typically yield colorimetric  responses that are not readily perceivable by naked eye. Herein, we report a  pixelated analysis approach for correlating colorimetric responses of CPE with  nucleic acid concentrations down to 1 nM, in plasma samples, utilizing a smart phone  with an algorithm that can perform analytical testing and data processing. The  detection strategy employed relies on conformational transitions between single  stranded nucleic acid-cationic CPE duplexes and double stranded nucleic acid-CPE  triplexes that yield distinct colorimetric responses for enabling naked eye  detection of nucleic acids. Cationic  poly[N,N,N-triethyl-3-((4-methylthiophen-3-yl)oxy)propan-1-aminium bromide] is  utilized as the CPE reporter deposited on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane  for nucleic acid assay. A smart phone application is developed to capture and  digitize the colorimetric response of the individual pixels of the digital images of  CPE on the PVDF membrane, followed by an analysis using the algorithm. The proposed  pixelated approach enables precise quantification of nucleic acid assay  concentrations, thereby eliminating the margin of error involved in conventional  methodologies adopted for interpretation of colorimetric responses, for instance,  RGB analysis. The obtained results illustrate that a ubiquitous smart phone could be  utilized for point of care colorimetric nucleic acids assays in complex matrices  without requiring sophisticated software or instrumentation.

AB  - Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth and has become a serious  public health problem. There has been limited research on strategies to decrease the  likelihood of reattempt in adolescents. As phase one of a treatment development  study, clinicians, parents and adolescents participated in qualitative interviews in  order to gain new perspectives on developing a targeted intervention and a safety  plan phone application for suicide prevention. Participants indicated that  transition of care, specific treatment targets and safety planning were important  parts of treatment. In addition, all participants endorsed the use of a smartphone  application for these purposes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rabies is estimated to cause 59,000 deaths and economic losses of US$8.6  billion every year. Despite several years of rabies surveillance and awareness  programmes, increased availability of post-exposure prophylaxis vaccinations and dog  population control, the disease still remains prevalent in Sri Lanka. This study  reports the roll-out of a high number, high coverage canine rabies vaccination  campaign in Sri Lanka, providing estimates for the vaccination coverage achieved,  analysing the local dog demographics, and identifying barriers of attendance to  static vaccination clinics. METHODS: A mass dog vaccination campaign was undertaken  in Negombo, Sri Lanka. The campaign was composed of static point and door-to-door  vaccination stages, with a final survey of vaccination coverage. A large volume of  data on the distribution, health, and signalment of vaccinated dogs was collected  through a mobile phone application. A logistic regression model was developed to  investigate which socio-spatial and dog-related factors influenced attendance of  owners to static vaccination points. RESULTS: The campaign vaccinated over 7800 dogs  achieving a vaccination coverage of 75.8%. A dog:human ratio of 1:17 was estimated.  Most dogs were owned, and the dog population was mostly male, adult, and  non-sterilized. Unawareness, unavailability and handling problems were the most  common reasons given by owners to explain failure to attend a static vaccination  point. The regression analysis showed that increasing distance to a static point, in  addition to young age and poor health of the dog, were associated with a decrease in  the likelihood of attendance to a static vaccination points. CONCLUSION: This study  demonstrates the feasibility of high number, high coverage vaccination campaigns in  Sri Lanka. The information on dog ecology and barriers of attendance to static point  vaccination clinics will facilitate development of future vaccination campaigns.

AB  - In this paper we describe a combination of paper-based sensors and a novel  smart-phone application for on-site quantification of colorimetric readouts as an  ultra-low cost solution to monitoring water quality. The system utilizes a  paper-based analytical device (μPAD) that produces a colorimetric signal that is  dependent on the concentration of a specific target; a cell phone equipped with a  camera for capturing images of two μPADs - one tested with a water sample and the  other tested with clean water that is used as a control; and an on-site image  processing app that uses a novel algorithm for quantifying color intensity and  relating this to contaminant concentration. The cell phone app utilizes a pixel  counting algorithm that performs with less bias and user subjectivity than the  typically used lab-based software, ImageJ. The use of a test and control strip  reduces bias from variations in ambient lighting, making it possible to acquire and  process images on-site. The cell phone is also able to GPS tag the location of the  test, and transmit results to a newly developed website, WaterMap.ca, that displays  the quantitative results from the water samples on a map. We demonstrate our  approach using a previously developed μPAD that detects the presence of  organophosphate pesticides based on the inhibition of immobilized  acetylcholinesterase by these contaminants. The objective of this paper is to  highlight the importance and potential of developing and integrated monitoring  system consisting of μPADs, cell-phones and a centralized web portal for low-cost  monitoring environmental contaminants at a large-scale.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the significant burden of stroke in rural China, secondary  prevention of stroke is suboptimal. This study aims to develop a SINEMA for the  secondary prevention of stroke in rural China and to evaluate the effectiveness of  the model compared with usual care. METHODS: The SINEMA model is being implemented  and evaluated through a 1-year cluster-randomized controlled trial in Nanhe County,  Hebei Province in China. Fifty villages from 5 townships are randomized in a 1:1  ratio to either the intervention or the control arm (usual care) with a target to  enroll 25 stroke survivors per village. Village doctors in the intervention arm (1)  receive systematic cascade training by stroke specialists on clinical guidelines,  essential medicines and behavior change; (2) conduct monthly follow-up visits with  the support of a mobile phone application designed for this study; (3) participate  in virtual group activities with other village doctors; 4) receive performance  feedback and payment. Stroke survivors participate in a health education and project  briefing session, receive monthly follow-up visits by village doctors and receive a  voice message call daily as reminders for medication use and physical activities.  Baseline and 1-year follow-up survey will be conducted in all villages by trained  staff who are blinded of the randomized allocation of villages. The primary outcome  will be systolic blood pressure and the secondary outcomes will include diastolic  blood pressure, medication adherence, mobility, physical activity level and quality  of life. Process and economic evaluation will also be conducted. DISCUSSION: This  study is one of very few that aim to promote secondary prevention of stroke in  resource-constrained settings and the first to incorporate mobile technologies for  both healthcare providers and patients in China. The SINEMA model is innovative as  it builds the capacity of primary healthcare workers in the rural area, uses mobile  health technologies at the point of care, and addresses critical health needs for a  vulnerable community-dwelling patient group. The findings of the study will provide  translational evidence for other resource-constrained settings in developing  strategies for the secondary prevention of stroke.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The forgotten ureteral stent (FUS) can lead to patient morbidity. To  date, tracking ureteral stents is a cumbersome task, given their high frequency of  insertion and variable indwelling times. To simplify this process, an application  was developed to track patients with indwelling ureteral stents. We report our  initial user experience and clinical outcomes with this application. METHODS:  Ureteral Stent Tracker™ (UST) is a secure, Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act (HIPPA)-compliant, cloud-based point-of-care application. It is  designed for logging stent insertion, scheduling the date of anticipated stent  extraction, and confirming stent removal. It is accessible via a mobile phone  application or web browser interface. We consecutively enrolled all patients who  underwent ureteral stent insertion for any indication by two urologists from January  10, 2015, to October 10, 2016. A retrospective chart review was performed of all  patients included in the UST database. Data extracted included patient demographics,  diagnosis, procedure, and stent characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients  were included with a mean age of 52.4 years; 54% (62/115) were male and 58% (67/115)  were Caucasian. This cohort represented 146 ureteral stent care plans with 23  patients (23/115; 20%) having more than one care plan during the study period. The  most common procedure performed was ureteroscopy (70/146; 48%) for a diagnosis of  nephrolithiasis (108/146; 74%). The median indwelling ureteral stent time was 14  days (interquartile range: 7-45 days). A total of three patients (3/115; 3%) did not  return for their scheduled extraction, but were identified only through the  application. Each patient was contacted, resulting in effective removal of all three  stents in the office. CONCLUSIONS: Tracking of ureteral stents is critical to  prevent the patient safety issue of the FUS. The UST is a secure, HIPPA-compliant,  cloud-based application, which once incorporated into the workflow of a urologic  practice can prevent the FUS.

T2  - JMIR mental health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Encouraging middle-aged adults to maintain their physical and cognitive  health may have a significant impact on reducing the prevalence of dementia in the  future. Mobile phone apps and interactive websites may be one effective way to  target this age group. However, to date there has been little research investigating  the user experience of dementia risk reduction tools delivered in this way.  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore participant engagement and  evaluations of three different targeted smartphone and Web-based dementia risk  reduction tools following a four-week intervention. METHODS: Participants completed  a Web-based screening questionnaire to collect eligibility information. Eligible  participants were asked to complete a Web-based baseline questionnaire and were then  randomly assigned to use one of the three dementia risk reduction tools for a period  of four weeks: (1) a mobile phone application; (2) an information-based website; and  (3) an interactive website. User evaluations were obtained via a Web-based follow-up  questionnaire after completion of the intervention. RESULTS: Of 415 eligible  participants, 370 (89.16%) completed the baseline questionnaire and were assigned to  an intervention group; 200 (54.05%) completed the post-intervention questionnaire.  The average age of participants was 52 years, and 149 (75%) were female. Findings  indicated that participants from all three intervention groups reported a generally  positive impression of the tools across a range of domains. Participants using the  information-based website reported higher ratings of their overall impression of the  tool, F2,191=4.12, P=.02; how interesting the information was, F2,189=3.53, P=.03;  how helpful the information was, F2,192=4.15, P=.02; and how much they learned,  F2,188=3.86, P=.02. Group differences were significant between the mobile phone app  and information-based website users, but not between the interactive website users  and the other two groups. Additionally, participants using the information-based  website reported significantly higher scores on their ratings of the ease of  navigation, F2,190=4.20, P=.02, than those using the mobile phone app and the  interactive website. There were no significant differences between groups on ratings  of ease of understanding the information, F2,188=0.27, P=.76. Most participants from  each of the three intervention groups indicated that they intended to keep using the  dementia risk reduction eHealth tool. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results indicated that  while participants across all three intervention groups reported a generally  positive experience with the targeted dementia risk reduction tools, participants  using the information-based website provided a more favorable evaluation across a  range of areas than participants using the mobile phone app. Further research is  required to investigate whether targeted dementia risk reduction tools, in the form  of interactive websites and mobile apps, can be improved to provide benefits above  those gained by providing static information alone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether for research or quality improvement, assessment of postoperative  quality of life outcomes faces a challenge in reliable data collection. Typical  coordinator-led studies cite response rates from 35% to 70%. This study evaluates  the utility of a digital patient engagement platform to track patient-reported  outcome measures (PROMs) following septoplasty and functional endoscopic sinus  surgery (FESS). METHODS: A prospective cohort was recruited at a tertiary care  center from January 2017 to March 2018. A mobile phone application relayed PROMs,  including pain (assessed on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale [VAS] every other day  for 2 weeks, as well as the patient-reported outcome measure information system  [PROMIS] pain interference short form 4a at baseline, 2 weeks, and 3 months) and  timing of return to work. RESULTS: Of 288 patients enrolled, 249 (86.5%) provided  clinical data, including 208 who underwent septoplasty or FESS. Granular VAS scores,  submitted by 195 patients, demonstrated 80% of these patients achieved minimal pain  by postoperative day 8. A nonsignificant trend of increased days to pain relief by  procedure emerged: septoplasty (mean ± standard deviation [SD], 3.60 ± 2.44), FESS  (3.96 ± 3.25), FESS with septoplasty (4.40 ± 3.04), and FESS with drilling (4.86 ±  3.68). Across procedures, PROMIS pain interference increased at 2 weeks (9.17 ±  4.15) and decreased at 3 months (5.32 ± 2.61) compared with baseline (7.09 ± 4.63),  with greater improvement noted in the FESS subgroup at 3 months. Patients returned  to work at mean 7.1 days regardless of procedure. CONCLUSIONS: With its high  response rate, mobile digital patient engagement platforms may effectively track  postoperative outcomes with the potential for reduced sample bias.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical high-risk (CHR) state is identified as a critical period  for early prevention and intervention during the development of psychosis and early  treatment may reduce the risk of conversion to psychosis. However, it remains  controversial whether antipsychotics are effective in CHR populations. Limited  previous randomised controlled trials of antipsychotic treatment of CHR individuals  indicated possible short-term efficacy on psychotic symptoms with unclear long-term  effects. To answer this question, it is necessary to establish a high-quality  real-world cohort study with large sample size to explore the effectiveness and  safety of antipsychotics in CHR individuals. METHODS: We plan to consecutively  recruit 600 CHR individuals from Shanghai Mental Health Centre in the ongoing  SHARP-2 (ShangHai At Risk for Psychosis-Phase 2) project between 2019 and 2022. At  baseline, participants will be assessed by the Structured Interview for Prodromal  Syndromes, the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery, demographic information, and  clinical medication history. They will be followed up in a naturalistic way in which  the research team will not prescribe antipsychotics or provide pharmacological  consultation. First, CHR participants and their families will be trained to record  their medication daily and self-evaluate symptoms through smart-phone  application-based assessment and report their information weekly. Second, telephone  calls will be arranged monthly so that the researchers are informed about the  participants' symptoms, medications and daily functions. Third, face-to-face  interviews will be conducted annually for repeating assessment of baseline. The  primary outcomes will include conversion to psychosis and functional outcome (scored  with less than 60 in the Global Assessment of Function) at the end of the follow-up  period. CONCLUSION: The current study will improve our knowledge on the  effectiveness and safety of the use of antipsychotics at the prodromal phase, and  will eventually facilitate optimisation of individualised interventions for  psychosis prevention and treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection of febrile illnesses at community level is essential for  improved malaria case management and control. Currently, mobile phone-based  technology has been commonly used to collect and transfer health information and  services in different settings. This study assessed the applicability of mobile  phone-based technology in real-time reporting of fever cases and management of  malaria by village health workers (VHWs) in north-eastern Tanzania. METHODS: The  community mobile phone-based disease surveillance and treatment for malaria  (ComDSTM) platform, combined with mobile phones and web applications, was developed  and implemented in three villages and one dispensary in Muheza district from  November 2013 to October 2014. A baseline census was conducted in May 2013. The data  were uploaded on a web-based database and updated during follow-up home visits by  VHWs. Active and passive case detection (ACD, PCD) of febrile cases were done by  VHWs and cases found positive by malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) were given the  first dose of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) at the dispensary. Each patient was  visited at home by VHWs daily for the first 3 days to supervise intake of  anti-malarial and on day 7 to monitor the recovery process. The data were captured  and transmitted to the database using mobile phones. RESULTS: The baseline  population in the three villages was 2934 in 678 households. A total of 1907 febrile  cases were recorded by VHWs and 1828 (95.9%) were captured using mobile phones. At  the dispensary, 1778 (93.2%) febrile cases were registered and of these, 84.2% were  captured through PCD. Positivity rates were 48.2 and 45.8% by RDT and microscopy,  respectively. Nine cases had treatment failure reported on day 7 post-treatment and  adherence to treatment was 98%. One patient with severe febrile illness was referred  to Muheza district hospital. CONCLUSION: The study showed that mobile phone-based  technology can be successfully used by VHWs in surveillance and timely reporting of  fever episodes and monitoring of treatment failure in remote areas. Further  optimization and scaling-up will be required to utilize the tools for improved  malaria case management and drug resistance surveillance.

TI  - The preventive treatment of recurrent stone-formation: how can we improve compliance  in the treatment of patients with recurrent stone disease?
AU  - Kok, Dirk Jan
T2  - Urolithiasis
AB  - Whether prevention of Urolithiasis is worthwhile is the outcome of the balance  between efficacy of prevention and costs and efforts related of respectively  prevention and treatment of a new stone. Well controlled trials demonstrate that  effective prevention of new stone formation is possible using medical treatment and  lifestyle interventions. In long-term general practice the results obtained with  preventive interventions is disappointing. Low and diminishing long-term compliance  to the intervention is a major cause for this. Both the long-term aspect and the  natural resistance to lifestyle changes contribute to this low compliance. From an  analysis of the existing data on trials of preventive interventions and from  experiences obtained in other patient groups where lifestyle changes are applied I  will make the case that self-empowerment of the patient using m-health lifestyle  coaching (a smart phone application) can considerably enhance the level of  prevention that is obtained in general practice. In conclusion, I will describe what  features will improve usage and efficacy of such an app.

T2  - BMC pregnancy and childbirth
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stillbirth is a devastating pregnancy outcome that has a profound and  lasting impact on women and families. Globally, there are over 2.6 million  stillbirths annually and progress in reducing these deaths has been slow. Maternal  perception of decreased fetal movements (DFM) is strongly associated with  stillbirth. However, maternal awareness of DFM and clinical management of women  reporting DFM is often suboptimal. The My Baby's Movements trial aims to evaluate an  intervention package for maternity services including a mobile phone application for  women and clinician education (MBM intervention) in reducing late gestation  stillbirth rates. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a stepped wedge cluster randomised  controlled trial with sequential introduction of the MBM intervention to 8 groups of  3-5 hospitals at four-monthly intervals over 3 years. The target population is women  with a singleton pregnancy, without lethal fetal abnormality, attending for  antenatal care and clinicians providing maternity care at 26 maternity services in  Australia and New Zealand. The primary outcome is stillbirth from 28 weeks'  gestation. Secondary outcomes address: a) neonatal morbidity and mortality; b)  maternal psychosocial outcomes and health-seeking behaviour; c) health services  utilisation; d) women's and clinicians' knowledge of fetal movements; and e) cost.  256,700 births (average of 3170 per hospital) will detect a 30% reduction in  stillbirth rates from 3/1000 births to 2/1000 births, assuming a significance level  of 5%. Analysis will utilise generalised linear mixed models. DISCUSSION: Maternal  perception of DFM is a marker of an at-risk pregnancy and commonly precedes a  stillbirth. MBM offers a simple, inexpensive resource to reduce the number of  stillborn babies, and families suffering the distressing consequences of such a  loss. This large pragmatic trial will provide evidence on benefits and potential  harms of raising awareness of DFM using a mobile phone app. TRIAL REGISTRATION:  ACTRN12614000291684.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Arterial hypertension is a highly important  cardiovascular risk factor, with low control percentages. New technologies can help  to obtain a better control of this disease. The intention is to know if a mobile  application can help achieve this goal. METHOD: A mobile phone application is used  to give feedback to physicians with the aim of generate competitiveness in achieving  objectives. The application could, at any time, determine the rate of controlled  patients (<140/90mmHg) by each physician, and compare them with the mean number of  the patients controlled by the group. The possible changes in the therapeutic  attitude of physicians are also analysed and the differences in achieving  objectives are compared based on specific characteristics of patients. RESULTS: The  study included 220 patients aged 18-80 years, with mean blood pressure>140/90mmHg,  despite medical treatment, tracked for 4 visits. At the end of the follow-up, 69.03%  achieved good control, compared to 12.8% in the baseline study (P<.001), with no  differences between gender (control of 68.6 and 69.29% of women and men,  respectively), nor among the different levels of cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSIONS:  The use of interactive tools that allow the dynamic process of feedback on the  results fosters the motivation and improves the therapeutic inertia in the control  of blood pressure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine  plus amodiaquine has been introduced in 12 African countries. Additional strategies  for safety monitoring are needed to supplement national systems of spontaneous  reporting that are known to under represent the incidence of adverse reactions.  OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine if adverse event (AE) reporting could be  improved using a smartphone application provided to village health workers, or by  active follow-up using a symptom card provided to caregivers. METHODS: Two  strategies to improve reporting of AEs during SMC campaigns were evaluated, in  comparison with the national system of spontaneous reporting, in 11 health post  areas in Senegal. In each health post, an average of approximately 4000 children  under 10 years of age received SMC treatment each month for 3 months during the 2015  malaria transmission season-a total of 134,000 treatments. In three health posts  (serving approximately 14,000 children), caregivers were encouraged to report any  adverse reactions to the nurse at the health post or to a community health worker  (CHW) in their village, who had been trained to use a smartphone application to  report the event (enhanced spontaneous reporting). In two health posts  (approximately 10,000 children), active follow-up of children at home was organized  after each SMC campaign to ask about AEs that caregivers had been asked to record on  a symptom card (active surveillance). Six health posts (approximately 23,000  children) followed the national system of spontaneous reporting using the national  reporting (yellow) form. Each AE report was assessed by a panel to determine likely  association with SMC drugs. RESULTS: The incidence of reported AEs was 2.4, 30.6,  and 21.6 per 1000 children treated per month, using the national system, enhanced  spontaneous reporting, and active surveillance, respectively. The most commonly  reported symptoms were vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain. The incidence of  vomiting, known to be caused by amodiaquine, was similar using both innovative  methods (10/1000 in the first month, decreasing to 2.5/1000 in the third month).  Despite increased surveillance, no serious adverse drug reactions were detected.  CONCLUSION: Training CHWs in each village and health facility staff to report AEs  using a mobile phone application led to much higher reporting rates than through the  national system. This approach is feasible and acceptable, and could be further  improved by strengthening laboratory investigation and the collection of control  data immediately prior to SMC campaigns.

AB  - CONTEXT: Given the proportion of Kenyan women not using hormonal contraceptives, the  country appears to have a substantial need for a modern, natural family planning  option. The CycleBeads® mobile phone application (app), a digital platform for the  Standard Days Method® of family planning, could help address this issue. METHODS:  After the CycleBeads app was promoted in Kenya in May-June 2015, a three-month pilot  study was conducted to collect quantitative and qualitative data from 185 female app  users. Chi-square testing, binary logistic regression and thematic content analysis  were used to assess whether the app brought new users to family planning, to  understand users' experiences and to assess how user experiences vary by  distribution channel. RESULTS: Participants learned about the app through  nongovernmental organizations (17%), via digital media (33%) or from family or  friends (50%). Most used the app to track their periods (54%) or prevent pregnancy  (37%); a few used it to plan a pregnancy (7%) or for other reasons (2%). The main  reason for choosing the Standard Days Method was fear of side effects from hormonal  methods (64%). The majority of women found the app and method easy to use (53%).  Among those preventing pregnancy, 42% had never before used a method. By midline,  all participants knew when fertile days occurred, and most (97%) knew the method's  cycle-length requirements. Women reported high rates of condom use (88%), abstinence  (68%) and withdrawal (46%) on fertile days. CONCLUSION: Offering the CycleBeads app  to support women in use of the Standard Days Method may expand family planning  options, reduce unmet need and make family planning more widely available.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a sleep disorder with long-term consequences.  Long-term effects include sleep-related issues and cardiovascular diseases. OSA is  often diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram. Monitoring can  be costly with long wait times for diagnosis. In this paper, a novel OSA screening  framework and prototype phone application are introduced. A database of 856 patients  that underwent at-home polygraphy was collected. Features were derived from audio,  actigraphy, photoplethysmography (PPG), and demographics, and used as the inputs of  a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM was trained on 735 patients and  tested on 121 patients. Classification on the test set had an accuracy of up to  92.2% when classifying subjects as having moderate or severe OSA versus being  healthy or a snorer based on the clinicians' diagnoses. The signal processing and  machine learning algorithms were ported to Java and integrated into the phone  application-SleepAp. SleepAp records the body position, audio, actigraphy and PPG  signals, and implements the clinically validated STOP-BANG questionnaire. It derives  features from the signals and classifies the user as having OSA or not using the SVM  trained on the clinical database. The resulting software could provide a new,  easy-to-use, low-cost, and widely available modality for OSA screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD),by identifying  individuals at risk is a well-established, but costly strategy when based on  measurements that depend on laboratory analyses. A non-laboratory, paper-based CVD  risk assessment chart tool has previously been developed to make screening more  affordable in developing countries. Task shifting to community health workers (CHWs)  is being investigated to further scale CVD risk screening. This study aimed to  develop a mobile phone CVD risk assessment application and to evaluate its impact on  CHW training and the duration of screening for CVD in the community by CHWs.  METHODS: A feature phone application was developed using the open source online  platform, CommCare(©). CHWs (n=24) were trained to use both paper-based and mobile  phone CVD risk assessment tools. They were randomly allocated to using one of the  risk tools to screen 10-20 community members and then crossed over to screen the  same number, using the alternate risk tool. The impact on CHW training time,  screening time and margin of error in calculating risk scores was recorded. A focus  group discussion evaluated experiences of CHWs using the two tools. RESULTS: The  training time was 12.3h for the paper-based chart tool and 3h for the mobile phone  application. 537 people were screened. The mean screening time was 36 min (SD=12.6)  using the paper-base chart tool and 21 min (SD=8.71) using the mobile phone  application, p=<0.0001. Incorrect calculations (4.3% of average systolic BP  measurements, 10.4% of BMI and 3.8% of CVD risk score) were found when using the  paper-based chart tool while all the mobile phone calculations were correct.  Qualitative findings from the focus group discussion corresponded with the findings  of the pilot study. CONCLUSION: The reduction in CHW training time, CVD risk  screening time, lack of errors in calculation of a CVD risk score and end user  satisfaction when using a mobile phone application, has implications in terms of  adoption and sustainability of this primary prevention strategy to identify people  with high CVD risk who can be referred for appropriate diagnoses and treatment.

AB  - Autism is a complex neurobiological disorder that is part of a group of disorders  known as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Today, one in 150 individuals is diagnosed  with autism. Lack of social interaction and problems with communication are the main  characteristics displayed by children with ASD. The Picture Exchange Communication  System (PECS) is a communication system where children exchange visual symbols as a  form of communication. The visual symbols are laminated pictures stored in a binder.  We have designed, developed and are currently testing a software application, called  PixTalk which works on any Windows Mobile Smart-phone. Teachers and caregivers can  access a web site and select from an online library the images to be downloaded on  to the Smart-phone. Children can browse and select images to express their  intentions, desires, and emotions using PixTalk. Case study results indicate that  PixTalk can be used as part of ongoing therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the most common cause of hearing loss  in children. Early diagnosis is important as hearing loss affects speech and  language development in children. The aim of this study was to compare conventional  audiometry with the Android mobile operating system application Hearing TestTM in  the evaluation of hearing thresholds in children with OME and to determine the  accuracy and reliability of the mobile application. Design and Study Sample: Fifty  school-age children aged between 5 and 15 years with OME in at least 1 ear were  included in the study. First, hearing thresholds were obtained by conventional  audiometric methods and the degree of hearing loss was determined. Then, the hearing  thresholds of the patients were measured using the smartphone-based Hearing TestTM  application. The data were compared using Cohen's kappa analysis. RESULTS: OME was  detected in 88 ears. There was no statistically significant correlation between the  hearing threshold results obtained with the mobile phone and conventional audiometry  at 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz. CONCLUSION: The Android mobile phone application  Hearing TestTM (version 1.1.3) is not an appropriate screening test to detect  hearing loss in children with OME.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to present our single-center real-life experience of canakinumab  use in adult patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). METHODS: Data were  derived from the Gazi FMF cohort, which was established in 2010. From that year, all  patients with FMF were registered. The impact of FMF on their lives was tracked by  either an FMF diary or mobile phone application (FMF-AIDD, free to download in App  Store and Google Play). The records of patients who were treated with canakinumab  were reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-three adult patients with FMF (65% female) were  enrolled in this study. The median age was 32 years (min-max, 24-58 years), and the  disease duration was 26 years (14-59 years). A total of 86% of patients harbored  homozygous or compound heterozygous exon 10 MEFV mutations. Indications for  interleukin 1 inhibitor use were colchicine resistance (n = 12) or intolerance (n =  2), amyloidosis (n = 7), and chronic manifestations of the disease (n = 2). All  patients used anakinra before. The median duration of canakinumab use was 7 months  (min-max, 1-44 months). Pre- and post-canakinumab periods were compared. Attack  severity, duration, frequency, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte  sedimentation rate were significantly improved (p ≤ 0.01), whereas serum creatinine  and alanine aminotransferase levels remained the same (p = 0.27 and p = 0.74,  respectively). Canakinumab achieved complete disease remission in 14 patients (60%).  Canakinumab was discontinued in 7 patients. The reasons for discontinuation were  pregnancy (n = 2), dominance of axial spondyloarthropathy (n = 2), inflammatory  bowel disease, patient's refusal, and weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Canakinumab is  effective in the prevention of FMF bouts without severe adverse effects. Treatment  with canakinumab in an individualized dose and interval may be a reasonable choice  for colchicine- and anakinra-resistant or -intolerant adult patients with FMF and  those with chronic manifestations of disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess and report the feasibility and efficacy of electronic follow-up  in patients after mid-urethral sling (MUS) operation. METHODS: All 235 patients  after MUS operation for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were divided into the  WeChat follow-up (WFU) and the outpatient follow-up (OFU) groups. Patients completed  electronic or paper-validated questionnaires. Demographic and clinical  characteristics, questionnaire scores, loss to follow-up rate, patient satisfaction,  and complications were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 189 patients  completed the follow-up assessment. The OFU group showed a higher rate of loss to  follow-up (25.6% vs. 13.2%, p = 0.016). The mean preoperative International  Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI  SF) scores were 18.22 ± 2.64 and 18.06 ± 2.75 in the WFU and OFU groups,  respectively (p = 0.672). The mean postoperative ICIQ-UI SF scores were 3.70 ± 1.65  and 3.86 ± 1.48, respectively (p = 0.489). There were 84.8% of WFU patients and 80%  of OFU patients reported "very much better" or "much better" on the Patient Global  Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scale (p = 0.381). Patient satisfaction rate was  higher in the WFU group than in the OFU group (87.9% vs. 74.4%, p = 0.018).  Seventeen patients reported postoperative complications (9 and 8 patients in the WFU  and OFU groups, respectively, p = 0.961). CONCLUSIONS: It appears that electronic  follow-up using a mobile phone application is feasible and efficient for patients  after MUS operation, and may be associated with improved rates of satisfaction and  retention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection is a major public health problem  worldwide affecting mostly youth. Sweden introduced an opportunistic screening  approach in 1982 accompanied by treatment, partner notification and case reporting.  After an initial decline in infection rate till the mid-90s, the number of reported  cases has increased over the last two decades and has now stabilized at a high level  of 37,000 reported cases in Sweden per year (85% of cases in youth). Sexual  risk-taking among youth is also reported to have significantly increased over the  last 20 years. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions could be particularly suitable  for youth and sexual health promotion as the intervention is delivered in a familiar  and discrete way to a tech savvy at-risk population. This paper presents a protocol  for a randomized trial to study the effect of an interactive mHealth application  (app) on condom use among the youth of Stockholm. METHODS: 446 youth resident in  Stockholm, will be recruited in this two arm parallel group individually randomized  trial. Recruitment will be from Youth Health Clinics or via the trial website.  Participants will be randomized to receive either the intervention (which comprises  an interactive app on safe sexual health that will be installed on their smart  phones) or a control group (standard of care). Youth will be followed up for  6 months, with questionnaire responses submitted periodically via the app.  Self-reported condom use over 6 months will be the primary outcome. Secondary  outcomes will include presence of an infection, Chlamydia tests during the study  period and proxy markers of safe sex. Analysis is by intention to treat. DISCUSSION:  This trial exploits the high mobile phone usage among youth to provide a phone app  intervention in the area of sexual health. If successful, the results will have  implications for health service delivery and health promotion among the youth. From  a methodological perspective, this trial is expected to provide information on the  strength and challenges of implementing a partially app (internet) based trial in  this context.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile phone sensors can be used to develop context-aware systems that  automatically detect when patients require assistance. Mobile phones can also  provide ecological momentary interventions that deliver tailored assistance during  problematic situations. However, such approaches have not yet been used to treat  major depressive disorder. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate  the technical feasibility, functional reliability, and patient satisfaction with  Mobilyze!, a mobile phone- and Internet-based intervention including ecological  momentary intervention and context sensing. METHODS: We developed a mobile phone  application and supporting architecture, in which machine learning models (ie,  learners) predicted patients' mood, emotions, cognitive/motivational states,  activities, environmental context, and social context based on at least 38  concurrent phone sensor values (eg, global positioning system, ambient light, recent  calls). The website included feedback graphs illustrating correlations between  patients' self-reported states, as well as didactics and tools teaching patients  behavioral activation concepts. Brief telephone calls and emails with a clinician  were used to promote adherence. We enrolled 8 adults with major depressive disorder  in a single-arm pilot study to receive Mobilyze! and complete clinical assessments  for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Promising accuracy rates (60% to 91%) were achieved by  learners predicting categorical contextual states (eg, location). For states rated  on scales (eg, mood), predictive capability was poor. Participants were satisfied  with the phone application and improved significantly on self-reported depressive  symptoms (beta(week) = -.82, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.43) and interview  measures of depressive symptoms (beta(week) = -.81, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d =  3.55). Participants also became less likely to meet criteria for major depressive  disorder diagnosis (b(week) = -.65, P = .03, per-protocol remission rate = 85.71%).  Comorbid anxiety symptoms also decreased (beta(week) = -.71, P < .001, per-protocol  Cohen d = 2.58). CONCLUSIONS: Mobilyze! is a scalable, feasible intervention with  preliminary evidence of efficacy. To our knowledge, it is the first ecological  momentary intervention for unipolar depression, as well as one of the first attempts  to use context sensing to identify mental health-related states. Several lessons  learned regarding technical functionality, data mining, and software development  process are discussed.

AB  - PURPOSE: An interactive mobile phone application was added to an established  Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program to determine the impact on ERAS  compliance as well as clinical outcomes. METHODS: We identified patients undergoing  elective colorectal surgery enrolled in our ERAS program from February 2017 to July  2018. Patients enrolled in a phone application were compared with those not enrolled  in terms of age, sex, diagnosis, operative approach, bowel preparation, oral intake  and solid food intake, ERAS pathway adherence, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A  total of 289 patients were included: 147 enrolled and 142 not enrolled in the phone  application. The mean age of enrollees was 53.0 years, compared with 58.3 years for  the non-enrollees (p = 0.003). The mean ERAS pathway medication adherence for  enrollees was 82.1% versus 76.8% for those not enrolled (p = 0.005). The mean LOS  and SSI rates for those enrolled versus not enrolled in the phone application was  4.4 days versus 6.4 days (p = 0.006) and 3.4% versus 11.3% (p = 0.019),  respectively. There was no significant difference in readmission rates between  enrollees and non-enrollees (15% versus 10.6%, p = 0.345). The mean total cost of  patients enrolled was $11,560; total cost of those not enrolled was $13,946  (p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Use of an interactive phone application is associated with  improved medication ERAS adherence along with significant reduction in length of  stay and SSI rates without increasing total cost.

AB  - Smart cities require interactive management of water supply networks and water  meters play an important role in such a task. As compared to fully mechanical water  meters, electromechanical water meters or fully electronic water meters can collect  real-time information through automatic meter reading (AMR), which makes them more  suitable for smart cities applications. In this paper, we first study the design  principles of existing water meters, and then present our design and implementation  of a self-powered smart water meter. The proposed water meter is based on a water  turbine generator, which serves for two purposes: (i) to sense the water flow  through adaptive signal processing performed on the generated voltage; and (ii) to  produce electricity to charge batteries for the smart meter to function properly. In  particular, we present the design considerations and implementation details. The  wireless transceiver is integrated in the proposed water meter so that it can  provide real-time water flow information. In addition, a mobile phone application is  designed to provide a user with a convenient tool for water usage monitoring.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Private practitioner's (PPs) collaboration for detection, diagnosis and  treatment of tuberculosis (TB) is recommended by the World Health Organization and  encouraged by the Indonesian National TB control programme. TB case management by  PPs, however, are mostly not in line with current guidelines. Therefore, we  developed an intervention package for PPs comprising of TB training, implementation  of a mobile phone application for notification of TB cases and a 6-month regular  follow-up with PPs. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention  package to increase TB case detection and notification rates among PPs in five  community health centre areas in Bandung City, Indonesia. RESULTS: A total of 87 PPs  were registered within the study area of whom 17 attended the training and 12 had  the mobile phone application successfully installed. The remaining five PPs had  phones that did not support the application. During the follow-up period, five PPs  registered patients with TB symptoms and cases into the application. A total of 36  patients with TB symptoms were identified and 17 were confirmed TB positive.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Following stroke, people are generally less active and more sedentary  which can worsen outcomes. Mobile phone applications (apps) can support change in  health behaviors. We developed STARFISH, a mobile phone app-based intervention,  which incorporates evidence-based behavior change techniques (feedback,  self-monitoring and social support), in which users' physical activity is visualized  by fish swimming. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential effectiveness of STARFISH in  stroke survivors. METHOD: Twenty-three people with stroke (12 women; age:  56.0 ± 10.0 years, time since stroke: 4.2 ± 4.0 years) from support groups in  Glasgow completed the study. Participants were sequentially allocated in a 2:1 ratio  to intervention (n = 15) or control (n = 8) groups. The intervention group followed  the STARFISH program for six weeks; the control group received usual care. Outcome  measures included physical activity, sedentary time, heart rate, blood pressure,  body mass index, Fatigue Severity Scale, Instrumental Activity of Daily Living  Scale, Ten-Meter Walk Test, Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale, and Psychological  General Well-Being Index. RESULTS: The average daily step count increased by 39.3%  (4158 to 5791 steps/day) in the intervention group and reduced by 20.2% (3694 to  2947 steps/day) in the control group (p = 0.005 for group-time interaction). Similar  patterns of data and group-time interaction were seen for walking time (p = 0.002)  and fatigue (p = 0.003). There were no significant group-time interactions for other  outcome measures. CONCLUSION: Use of STARFISH has the potential to improve physical  activity and health outcomes in people after stroke and longer term intervention  trials are warranted.

T2  - BMC medical informatics and decision making
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines support decision-making at the point-of-care but the  onus is often on individual users such as physicians to implement them. Research  shows that the inclusion of implementation tools in or with guidelines (GItools) is  associated with guideline use. However, there is little research on which GItools  best support implementation by individual physicians. The purpose of this study was  to investigate naturalistic access and use of GItools produced by the American  Academy of Neurology (AAN) to inform future tool development. METHODS: Website  accesses over six months were summarized for eight AAN guidelines and associated  GItools published between July 2012 and August 2013. Academy members were surveyed  about use of tools accompanying the sport concussion guideline. Data were analyzed  using summary statistics and the Chi-square test. RESULTS: The clinician summary was  accessed more frequently (29.0%, p < 0.001) compared with the slide presentation  (26.8%), patient summary (23.2%) or case study (20.9%), although this varied by  guideline topic. For the sport concussion guideline, which was accompanied by a  greater variety of GItools, the mobile phone quick reference check application was  most frequently accessed, followed by the clinician summary, patient summary, and  slide presentation. For the sports concussion guideline survey, most respondents  (response rate 21.8%, 168/797) were aware of the guideline (88.1%) and had read the  guideline (78.6%). For GItool use, respondents indicated reading the reference card  (51.2%), clinician summary (45.2%), patient summary (28.0%), mobile phone  application (26.2%), and coach/athletic trainer summary (20.2%). Patterns of sports  concussion GItool use were similar between respondents who said they had and had not  yet implemented the guideline. CONCLUSIONS: Developers faced with resource  limitations may wish to prioritize the development of printable or mobile  application clinician summaries, which were accessed significantly more than other  types of GItools. Further research is needed to understand how to optimize the  design of such GItools.

AB  - We developed and tested a mobile phone application (app) to support individuals  embarking on a partial meal replacement programme (MRP). Overweight or obese women  were randomly allocated to one of two study groups. The intervention group received  an MRP Support app. The control group received a static app based on the information  available with the MRP. A total of 58 adult women (Support n = 28; Control n = 30)  participated in the 8-week trial. Their BMI was 26-43 kg/m(2) Usage data suggested  that the intervention group were more engaged with using the app throughout the  study period. Mixed modelling revealed that the difference in weight loss between  the intervention and control groups (estimated mean, EM = 3.2% and 2.2%  respectively) was not significant (P = 0.08). Objective data suggested that users of  the Support app were more engaged than those using the control app. A total of 1098  prompts (54%) asking people in the intervention group to enter their meals were  completed prior to the evening prompt. Women in the intervention group reported a  greater increase in positive affect (i.e. mood) than those in the control group (EM  = 0.48 and -0.01, respectively) (P = 0.012). At Week 8, those in the control group  reported a greater decrease in the effort they were willing to put into staying on  the diet than those who received the Support app (EM = -2.8 and -1.4, respectively)  (P = 0.024). The Support app could be a useful adjunct to existing MRPs for  psychological outcomes.

AB  - While there are many barcode readers available for identifying products in a  supermarket or at home on mobile phones (e.g., Red Laser iPhone app), such readers  are inaccessible to blind or visually impaired persons because of their reliance on  visual feedback from the user to center the barcode in the camera's field of view.  We describe a mobile phone application that guides a visually impaired user to the  barcode on a package in real-time using the phone's built-in video camera. Once the  barcode is located by the system, the user is prompted with audio signals to bring  the camera closer to the barcode until it can be resolved by the camera, which is  then decoded and the corresponding product information read aloud using  text-to-speech. Experiments with a blind volunteer demonstrate proof of concept of  our system, which allowed the volunteer to locate barcodes which were then  translated to product information that was announced to the user. We successfully  tested a series of common products, as well as user-generated barcodes labeling  household items that may not come with barcodes.

AB  - This study presents the design and implementation of a wearable wireless device,  connected to a smart phone, which monitors and prevents repetitive ankle sprain due  to chronic ankle instability (CAI). The device prevents this common foot injury by  electrical stimulation of the peroneal muscles using surface electrodes which causes  dorsiflexion of the foot. This is done after measuring ankle kinematics using  inertial motion sensors and predicting ankle sprain. The prototype implemented here  has a fast response time of 7 msec which enables prevention of ankle sprain before  ligament damage occurs. Wireless communication between the components of the device,  in addition to their small size, low cost and low power consumption, makes it  unobtrusive, easy to wear and not hinder normal activities. The device connects via  Bluetooth to an android smart phone application for continuous data logging and  reporting to keep track of the incidences of possible ankle sprain and correction.  This is a significant feature of this device since it enables monitoring of patients  with CAI and quantifying progression of the condition or improvement in the case of  treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of an increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and  more people having access to smartphones creates opportunities for patient care.  This study aims to investigate whether the use of the Diabetes Under Control (DBEES)  mobile phone application, a digital diabetes diary, results in a change in quality  of life for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) compared with the standard  paper diary. METHODS: In this randomized controlled open-label trial, 63 patients  with T1DM having access to a smartphone were assigned to the intervention group  using the DBEES application (n = 31) or the control group using the standard paper  diary (n = 32). Primary outcome was the change in quality of life, as measured by  the RAND-36 questionnaire, between both groups. Secondary outcomes included  diabetes-related distress (PAID), HbA1c, frequency of self-monitoring blood glucose,  and the usability of the diabetes application (SUS). RESULTS: Patients had a median  age (IQR) of 33 (21) years, diabetes duration of 17 (16) years, and an HbA1c of 62 ±  16 mmol/mol. No significant differences in the QOL, using the RAND-36, within and  between both groups were observed after 3 months. Glycemic control, diabetes-related  emotional distress, and frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose remained  within and between groups. Users reviewed the usability of DBEES with a 72 ± 20, on  a range of 0-100. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the DBEES application in the management of  patients with T1DM for 3 months yields no alterations in quality of life compared to  the standard paper diary.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore doctors' knowledge, willingness, concerns and the  countermeasures to the most stringent antimicrobial stewardship regulations of China  which implemented in August 2012. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. A pretested  32-point structured questionnaire was distributed to doctors by sending a web link  via the mobile phone application WeChat through snowball sampling methods and email  groups of medical academic societies. SETTING: China. PARTICIPANTS: Doctors. PRIMARY  AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The questionnaire inquired about the doctors'  experiences, knowledge, willingness, concerns and the countermeasures to the  stewardship policies. RESULTS: Total of persons in the groups was 19 791, among them  1194 submitted the answers, within them, 807 were doctors. Doctors had a mean age of  39.0 years. The majority (78.9% in 2012, 89.1% in 2016) reported that they were  willing or very willing to accept the regulations. Almost all respondents (93.2%)  felt the stewardship regulations had the potential to adversely affect the prognosis  of patients who would have been prescribed antimicrobials before they were  implemented, and >65% (65.7% in 2012, 66.9% in 2016) of doctors were often or always  concerned about the prognosis of these patients. In 2012, 32% of doctors prescribed  restricted antimicrobials or suggested patient self-medication with restricted  antimicrobials to address doctors' concerns, and this number decreased to 22.6% in  2016. Although compulsory antimicrobial stewardship training was frequent, less than  half of respondents (46.8%) responded correctly to all three knowledge questions.  CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial stewardship regulations had some positive effect on  rational antimicrobial use. Willingness and practice of doctors towards the  regulations improved from 2012 to 2016. Knowledge about rational antimicrobial use  was still lacking. Doctors found ways of accessing restricted antibiotics to address  their concerns about the prognosis of patients, which undermined the implementation  of the stewardship regulations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The transition from the home to college is a phase in which emerging  adults shift toward more unhealthy eating and physical activity patterns, higher  body mass indices, thus increasing risk of overweight/obesity. Currently, little is  understood about how changing friendship networks shape weight gain behaviors. This  paper describes the recruitment, data collection, and data analytic protocols for  the SPARC (Social impact of Physical Activity and nutRition in College) study, a  longitudinal examination of the mechanisms by which friends and friendship networks  influence nutrition and physical activity behaviors and weight gain in the  transition to college life. METHODS: The SPARC study aims to follow 1450 university  freshmen from a large university over an academic year, collecting data on multiple  aspects of friends and friendship networks. Integrating multiple types of data  related to student lives, ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) are administered  via a cell phone application, devilSPARC. EMAs collected in four 1-week periods (a  total of 4 EMA waves) are integrated with linked data from web-based surveys and  anthropometric measurements conducted at four times points (for a total of eight  data collection periods including EMAs, separated by ~1 month). University databases  will provide student card data, allowing integration of both time-dated data on food  purchasing, use of physical activity venues, and geographical information system  (GIS) locations of these activities relative to other students in their social  networks. DISCUSSION: Findings are intended to guide the development of more  effective interventions to enhance behaviors among college students that protect  against weight gain during college.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In many countries, a majority of stroke patients are not assessed for  long-term functional outcome owing to limited resources and time. We investigated  whether automatic assessment of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) based on a mobile  phone questionnaire may serve as an alternative to mRS assessments at clinical  visits after stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 62 acute stroke patients  admitted to our stroke unit during March to May 2014. Forty-eight patients completed  the study. During the stay, patients and/or caregivers were equipped with a mobile  phone application in their personal mobile phones. The mobile phone application  contained a set of 20 questions, based on the Rankin Focused Assessment, which we  previously tested in a pilot study. Three months after inclusion, the mobile phone  application automatically prompted the study participants to answer the mRS  questionnaire in the mobile phones. Each question or a group of questions in the  questionnaire corresponded to a certain mRS score. Using a predefined protocol, the  highest mRS score question where the study participant had answered yes was deemed  the final mobile mRS score. A few days later, a study personnel performed a clinical  visit mRS assessment. The 2 assessments were compared using quadratic weighing  κ-statistics. Mean age was 67 years (38% females), and median baseline National  Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 5 (interquartile range 2-10.5,  range 0-23). Median and mean clinical visit mRS at 3 months was 2 and 2.3,  respectively. We found a 62.5% agreement between clinical visit and mobile mRS  assessment, weighted kappa 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.82-0.96), and unweighted  kappa 0.53 (95% confidence interval 0.36-0.70). Dichotomized mRS outcome separating  functionally independent (mRS score 0-2) from dependent (mRS score 3-5) showed 83%  agreement and unweighted kappa of 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.45-0.87).  CONCLUSIONS: Mobile phone-based automatic assessments of mRS performed well in  comparison with clinical visit mRS and could be used as an alternative in stroke  follow-up.

T2  - BMC research notes
AB  - BACKGROUND: Workplace sedentary behaviour is a priority target for health promotion.  However, little is known about how to effect change. We aimed to explore desk-based  office workers' perceptions of factors that influenced sedentary behaviour at work  and to explore the feasibility of using a novel mobile phone application to track  their behaviours. METHODS: We invited office employees (n = 12) and managers (n = 2)  in a software engineering company to participate in semi-structured interviews to  explore perceived barriers and facilitators affecting workplace sedentary behaviour.  We assessed participants' sedentary behaviours using an accelerometer before and  after they used a mobile phone application to record their activities at  self-selected time intervals daily for 2 weeks. Interviews were analysed using a  thematic framework. RESULTS: Software engineers (5 employees; 2 managers) were  interviewed; 13 tested the mobile phone application; 8 returned feedback. Major  barriers to reducing workplace sedentary behaviour included the pressure of 'getting  the job done', the nature of their work requiring sitting at a computer, personal  preferences for the use of time at and after work, and a lack of facilities, such as  a canteen, to encourage moving from their desks. Facilitators for reduced  sedentariness included having a definite reason to leave their desks, social  interaction and relief of physical and mental symptoms of prolonged sitting. The  findings were similar for participants with different levels of overall physical  activity. Valid accelerometer data were tracked for four participants: all reduced  their sedentary behaviour. Participants stated that recording data using the phone  application added to their day's work but the extent to which individuals perceived  this as a burden varied and was counter-balanced by its perceived value in  increasing awareness of sedentary behaviour. Individuals expressed a wish for  flexibility in its configuration. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that  employers' and employees' perceptions of the cultural context and physical  environment of their work, as well as personal factors, must be considered in  attempting to effect changes that reduce workplace sedentary behaviour. Further  research should investigate appropriate individually tailored approaches to this  challenge, using a framework of behaviour change theory which takes account of  specific work practices, preferences and settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of multiple sclerosis (MS) information websites, online  communities, and Web-based health education programs has been increasing. However,  MS patients' willingness to use new ways of communication, such as websites, mobile  phone application, short message service, or email with their physician, remains  unknown. OBJECTIVES: We designed a questionnaire to evaluate the a priori use of  electronic communication methods by MS patients and to assess their acceptance of  such tools for communication with their health care providers. METHODS: We received  complete data from 586 MS patients aged between 17 and 73 years. Respondents were  surveyed in outpatient clinics across Germany using a novel paper-and-pencil  questionnaire. In addition to demographics, the survey items queried frequency of  use of, familiarity with, and comfort with using computers, websites, email, and  mobile phones. RESULTS: About 90% of all MS patients used a personal computer  (534/586) and the Internet (527/586) at least once a week, 87.0% (510/586)  communicated by email, and 85.6% (488/570) communicated by mobile phone. When asked  about their comfort with using electronic communication methods for communication  with health care providers, 20.5% (120/586) accepted communication by mobile  Internet application or short message service via mobile phone, 41.0% (240/586) by  websites, 54.3% (318/586) by email service, and 67.8% (397/586) by at least one type  of electronic communication. The level of a priori use was the best predictor for  the acceptance of electronic communication with health care providers. Patients who  reported already searching online for health information (odds ratio 2.4, P < .001)  and who had already communicated with a physician through a website (odds ratio 3.3,  P = .03) reported higher acceptance for Web-based communication. Patients who  already scheduled appointments with their mobile phones (odds ratio 2.1, P = .002)  were more likely to accept the use of mobile phone applications or short message  service for communicating with their physician. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of MS  patients seen at specialist centers already use modern communication technology  regularly. New forms of electronic communication appear to have high levels of  acceptance for exchanging information about MS between patients and health care  providers. Such methods should be integrated into eHealth services such as  electronic health records and patient relationship management systems.

AB  - Cloud computing has revolutionized healthcare in today's world as it can be  seamlessly integrated into a mobile application and sensor devices. The sensory data  is then transferred from these devices to the public and private clouds. In this  paper, a hybrid and distributed environment is built which is capable of collecting  data from the mobile phone application and store it in the cloud. We developed an  activity recognition application and transfer the data to the cloud for further  processing. Big data technology Hadoop MapReduce is employed to analyze the data and  create user timeline of user's activities. These activities are visualized to find  useful health analytics and trends. In this paper a big data solution is proposed to  analyze the sensory data and give insights into user behavior and lifestyle trends.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern flexible multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy requires people  with diabetes to manage complex mathematical calculations to determine insulin doses  on a day to day basis. Automated bolus calculators assist with these calculations,  add additional functionality to protect against hypoglycaemia and enhance the record  keeping process, however uptake and use depends on the devices meeting the needs of  the user. We aimed to obtain user feedback on the usability of a mobile phone bolus  calculator application in adults with T1DM to inform future development of mobile  phone diabetes support applications. METHODS: Adults with T1DM who had previously  received education in flexible MDI therapy were invited to participate. Eligible  respondents attended app education and one month later participated in a focus group  to provide feedback on the features of the app in relation to usability for  patient-based flexible MDI and future app development. RESULTS: Seven adults  participated in the app training and follow up interview. App features that support  dose adjustment to reduce hypoglycaemia risk and features that enable greater  efficiency in dose calculation, record keeping and report generation were highly  valued. CONCLUSIONS: Adults who are self managing flexible MDI found the Rapidcalc  mobile phone app to be a useful self-management tool and additional features to  further improve usability, such as connectivity with BG meter and food databases,  shortcut options to economise data entry and web based storage of data, were  identified. Further work is needed to ascertain specific features and benefit for  those with lower health literacy.

Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the  uChek(©) smart phone application can be used to diagnose underhydration based on  elevated urine specific gravity (USG) assessed by refractometry. Methods: One  hundred forty-seven (n = 147) fresh human urine samples from young and middle-age  adults were analyzed for USG with a refractometer and the uChek(©) application by  reading the Siemens Multistix 10G urine reagent strip. Results: Bland-Altman  analysis showed agreement of the two methods of assessment. Overall diagnostic  ability of the uChek(©) to identify underhydration was fair (area under the curve  79%). However, the sensitivity to correctly identify underhydration was poor (60%)  as well as the specificity of correctly identifying euhydration (53%). Conclusion:  The uChek(©) application does not accurately detect underhydration.

AB  - Photovoice is a research method developed to help communities share images as a tool  for discussion of key issues. Although this may be useful to promote healthy  behavior, using Photovoice in adolescents has been logistically challenging. Given  adolescents' engagement in social media, our study explored the feasibility of using  a photo-sharing mobile phone application, Instagram, to accomplish the principles of  Photovoice. Twenty adolescents 14 to 18 years old with type 1 diabetes were asked to  use Instagram to post any diabetes-related photo for 3 weeks. Individual interviews  and a focus group were also offered, and recruitment and retention statistics were  tracked. Of those approached (n = 47), 43% agreed to participate. Twelve were  actively engaged. Shared photos were most likely to fall into the categories of  diabetes care, humor, or food. Engaged participants universally reported the project  to be a positive experience; however, there were technological and personal factors  to consider for widespread implementation.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Getting ready for a colonoscopy is difficult and involves many  steps. Information given to patients is very important for adherence to treatment.  We created a novel smart phone application (SPA) aimed to increase bowel preparation  quality and patient satisfaction. METHODS: We carried out a prospective,  endoscopist-blinded, randomized, controlled trial. We enrolled 260 outpatient (58%  female, age range 21-75 years) owners of a smartphone. Patients were allocated to  two different protocols: instructions provided by SPA (SPA group; n = 108) or  written instructions with visual aids (control group; n = 152). All procedures were  carried out in the afternoon and patients received the same purgative regimen (2 L  polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution plus ascorbic acid), in a full-dose same-day  regimen. The study was designed to detect an improvement in quality of bowel  preparation using the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS) scale. Effect of protocol on  patient satisfaction was assessed with a specific questionnaire at the time of  colonoscopy. RESULTS: Proportion of patients who obtained successful bowel  preparation for colonoscopy (HCS A or B) was significantly higher in the SPA group  than in the control group (100% vs 96.1%, respectively; P = 0.037). Mean global HCS  scores were similar in both groups. Patient-reported tolerability and overall  experience with the prescribed bowel preparation were significantly higher for the  SPA group than for the control group. CONCLUSION: Successful cleansing and patient  acceptability with the use of SPA were superior to written instructions in  outpatients submitted for colonoscopy using 2 L PEG solution plus ascorbic acid.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric drug dosing errors occur at a high rate in the prehospital  environment. OBJECTIVE: To describe paramedic training and practice regarding  pediatric drug administration, exposure to pediatric drug dose errors and safety  culture among paramedics and EMS agencies in a national sample. METHODS: An  electronic questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 10,530 nationally certified  paramedics. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: There were 1,043 (9.9%)  responses and 1,014 paramedics met inclusion criteria. Nearly half (43.0%) were  familiar with a case where EMS personnel delivered an incorrect pediatric drug dose.  Over half (58.5%) believed their initial paramedic program did not include enough  pediatric training. Two-thirds (66.0%) administered a pediatric drug dose within the  past year. When estimating the weight of a pediatric patient, 54.2% used a  length-based tape, while 35.8% asked the parent or guardian, and 2.5% relied on a  smart phone application. Only 19.8% said their agency had an anonymous  error-reporting system and 50.7% believed they could report an error without fear of  disciplinary action. For solutions, 89.0% believed an EMS-specific Broselow-Luten  Tape would be helpful, followed by drug dosing cards in milliliters (83.0%) and  changing content of standardized pediatric courses to be more relevant (77.7%).  CONCLUSION: This national survey demonstrated a significant number of paramedics are  aware of a pediatric dosing error, safety systems specific to pediatric patients are  lacking, and that paramedics view pediatric drug cards and eliminating drug  calculations as helpful. Pediatric drug-dosing safety in the prehospital environment  can be improved.

T2  - Studies in health technology and informatics
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodic limb movements (PLMs) are repetitive, stereotypical and  unconscious movements, typically of the legs, that occur in sleep and are associated  with several sleep disorders. The gold standard for detecting PLMs is overnight  electromyography which, although highly sensitive and specific, is time and labour  consuming. The current generation of smart phones is equipped with tri-axial  accelerometers that record movement. AIM: To develop a smart phone application that  can detect PLMs remotely. METHOD: A leg movement sensing application (LMSA) was  programmed in iOS 5x and incorporated into an iPhone 4S (Apple INC.). A healthy  adult male subject underwent simultaneous EMG and LMSA measurements of voluntary  stereotypical leg movements. The mean number of leg movements recorded by EMG and by  the LMSA was compared. RESULTS: A total of 403 leg movements were scored by EMG of  which the LMSA recorded 392 (97%). There was no statistical difference in mean  number of leg movements recorded between the two modalities (p = 0.3). CONCLUSION:  These preliminary results indicate that a smart phone application is able to  accurately detect leg movements outside of the hospital environment and may be a  useful tool for screening and follow up of patients with PLMs.

AB  - We report on the fabrication of a syringe-based platform for automation of a  colorimetric malaria-Ab assay. We assembled this platform from inexpensive  disposable plastic syringes, plastic tubing, easily-obtainable servomotors, and an  Arduino microcontroller chip, which allowed for system automation. The automated  system can also be fabricated using stereolithography (SLA) to print elastomeric  reservoirs (used instead of syringes), while platform framework, including rack and  gears, can be printed with fused deposition modeling (FDM). We report on the  optimization of FDM and SLA print parameters, as well as post-production processes.  A malaria-Ab colorimetric test was successfully run on the automated platform, with  most of the assay reagents dispensed from syringes. Wash solution was dispensed from  an SLA-printed elastomeric reservoir to demonstrate the feasibility of both syringe  and elastomeric reservoir-based approaches. We tested the platform using a  commercially available malaria-Ab colorimetric assay originally designed for  spectroscopic plate readers. Unaided visual inspection of the assay solution color  change was sufficient for qualitative detection of positive and negative samples. A  smart phone application can also be used for quantitative measurement of the assay  color change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diffusion of novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), combined with the  ability of the Internet to act as an online marketplace, has led to unprecedented  challenges for governments, health agencies, and substance misuse services. Despite  increasing research, there is a paucity of reliable information available to  professionals working in the field. The paper will present the pilot results of the  first mobile application (SMAIL) for rapid information sharing on NPSs among health  professionals. METHODS: The development of SMAIL was divided into 2 parts: (a) the  creation of the application for registered users, enabling them to send an SMS or  email with the name or "street name" of an NPS and receive within seconds emails or  SMS with the information, when available and (b) the development of a database to  support the incoming requests. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two professionals based  in 22 countries used the service over the pilot period of 16 months (from May 2012  to September 2013). Five hundred fifty-seven enquires were made. Users received  rapid information on NPSs, and 61% of them rated the service as excellent.  CONCLUSIONS: This is the right time to use mobile phone technologies for rapid  information sharing and prevention activities on NPSs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Robust assessment is a crucial component in Advanced Cardiac Life  Support (ACLS) training to determine whether participants have achieved learning  objectives with little or no variation in their overall outcomes. This study aimed  to evaluate resuscitation performance by real-time logs. We hypothesised that  instructors may not be able to evaluate time-sensitive parameters, namely, chest  compression fraction, time to initiating chest compression and time to initiating  defibrillation accurately in a subjective manner. METHODS: Video records and formal  checklist-based test results of Megacode scenarios for the ACLS certification  examination at several hospitals in Taipei were examined. For the study interest,  three time-sensitive parameters were measured via video review assisted by a mobile  phone application, and were used for evaluation. We evaluated if the pass/fail  results made by instructors via checklists were correlated with these parameters.  RESULTS: A total of 185 Megacode scenarios were eligible for the final analysis.  Among the three parameters, good chest compression fraction was statistically  significant with a higher OR of passing (OR=3.65; 95% CI 1.36 to 9.91; p=0.01). In  112 participants with one parameter that did not meet the criteria, 25 were graded  as fail, making the specificity 22.3% (95% CI 15.0% to 31.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Visual  observation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance is not accurate when  evaluating time-sensitive parameters. Objective results should be offered for  training outcome evaluation, and also for feedback to participants.

AB  - Objective: To understand the prevalence of facility-based HIV testing and its  associated factors among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Beijing city. Methods:  An application-based cross-sectional survey was employed to understand HIV site test  situation and associated factors. The survey was carried out from May 14(th) to  21(st), 2016. Users of a smart phone application for gay dating were recruited and  those eligible for this survey were investigated with an online self-administered  questionnaire. Information of demographics, sexual behaviors, facility-based HIV  testing history and recreational drug abuses were collected. The multivariate  logistic regression was used to make comparison among different groups and assess  associated factors. Results: A total of 7 494 participants were enrolled in the  survey with mean age of (28.81 ± 7.38) years, 87.14% (6 530/7 494) sought sexual  partners through internet. The proportion of facility-based HIV testing in 1 year  was 42.55% (3 189/7 494), MSM who were 25-29 years had higher proportion of  facility-based HIV testing in 1 year, the proportion was 45.56%(1 104/2 423). Among  MSM who could insist in using condom during anal sex (50.46% (1 539/3 050)), the  proportion of HIV site testing in 1 year was higher. The MSM who reported seeking  healthcare for symptoms of a sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the past year  or ever using recreational drug had higher proportion of facility-based HIV testing,  the proportions were 56.81% (409/720) and 52.00% (1 340/4 917), respectively.  Compared with alone cohabitation, cohabitating was associated with decreased odds of  HIV facility-based testing in past 1 year(odds ratio (OR)= 0.79, P<0.001). Compared  with homosexual sexual orientation, bisexual sexual orientation was associated with  decreased odds of facility-based HIV testing (OR=0.83, P=0.004). With the increasing  of number of male anal sex partners, the odds of HIV facility-based testing was  increasing (OR=1.31, P<0.001) But with the decreasing of the frequency of condom  using with male anal sex partners, the odds of facility-based HIV testing was  decreasing (OR=0.85, P=0.014). Using recreational drugs (OR=1.36, P<0.001) and  seeking healthcare for symptoms of a STI in the past 1 year (OR=1.73, P<0.001) were  associated with decreased odds of HIV site testing. Conclusion: MSM in Beijing had  lower proportion of facility-based HIV testing in past 1 year. Multiple anal sex  partners, using recreational drugs, seeking healthcare for symptoms of a STI in the  past year, cohabitating, bisexual sexual orientation, and lower frequency of condom  using with male anal sex partners were associated with the odds of HIV  facility-based testing in past 1 year.

T2  - Informatics for health & social care
AB  - Research Interest: In this article, we take an interest in the new kind of relation  that has been claimed to be urgently required between health services and patients.  Co-production of health services implies fundamental changes in the ways medical  care is organized and delivered. Usually, technologies are put forth as potential  solutions to problems that might occur when establishing such new relations. AIMS:  The aim of this study is to scrutinize how different perspectives were brought into  the discussions as the concrete design and use of a mobile phone application were  introduced, and how participants anticipated and negotiated their own participation  in the design project. METHODS: This article reports results from an explorative  study of a co-design project in hypertension care wherein health professionals and  patients were invited to co-design some features of the application they were later  to use. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that new practices of self-treatment  are not likely to take place without the cooperation of patients, since they are to  provide the observational data necessary for the professionals' work. The  negotiations are needed to balance patients' concerns of being monitored by  technology and their needs of being in control of their everyday lives and  activities.

AB  - The analysis of lung sounds, collected through auscultation, is a fundamental  component of pulmonary disease diagnostics for primary care and general patient  monitoring for telemedicine. Despite advances in computation and algorithms, the  goal of automated lung sound identification and classification has remained elusive.  Over the past 40 years, published work in this field has demonstrated only limited  success in identifying lung sounds, with most published studies using only a small  numbers of patients (typically N<;20) and usually limited to a single type of lung  sound. Larger research studies have also been impeded by the challenge of labeling  large volumes of data, which is extremely labor-intensive. In this paper, we present  the development of a semi-supervised deep learning algorithm for automatically  classify lung sounds from a relatively large number of patients (N=284). Focusing on  the two most common lung sounds, wheeze and crackle, we present results from 11,627  sound files recorded from 11 different auscultation locations on these 284 patients  with pulmonary disease. 890 of these sound files were labeled to evaluate the model,  which is significantly larger than previously published studies. Data was collected  with a custom mobile phone application and a low-cost (US$30) electronic  stethoscope. On this data set, our algorithm achieves ROC curves with AUCs of 0.86  for wheeze and 0.74 for crackle. Most importantly, this study demonstrates how  semi-supervised deep learning can be used with larger data sets without requiring  extensive labeling of data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To facilitate the delivery of proven maternal, neonatal, and child  health (MNCH) services, a new cadre of village-based frontline workers, called the  Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), was created in 2005 under the aegis of  the National Rural Health Mission in India. Evaluations have noted that coverage of  selected MNCH services to be delivered by the ASHAs is low. Reasons for low coverage  are inadequate supervision and support to ASHAs apart from insufficient skills, poor  quality of training, and complexity of tasks to be performed. The proposed study  aims to implement and evaluate an innovative intervention based on mobile phone  technology (mHealth) to improve the performance of ASHAs through better supervision  and support in predominantly tribal and rural communities of Gujarat, India.  METHODS/DESIGN: This is a two-arm, stratified, cluster randomized trial of 36 months  in which the units of randomization will be Primary Health Centers (PHCs). There are  11 PHCs in each arm. The intervention is a newly built mobile phone application used  in the public health system and evaluated in three ways: (1) mobile phone as a job  aid to ASHAs to increase coverage of MNCH services; (2) mobile phone as a job aid to  ASHAs and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) to increase coverage of care among  complicated cases by facilitating referrals, if indicated and home-based care; (3)  web interface as a job aid for medical officers and PHC staff to improve supervision  and support to the ASHA program. Participants of the study are pregnant women,  mothers, infants, ASHAs, and PHC staff. Primary outcome measures are a composite  index made of critical, proven MNCH services and the proportion of neonates who were  visited by ASHAs at home within the first week of birth. Secondary outcomes include  coverage of selected MNCH services and care sought by complicated cases. Outcomes  will be measured by conducting household surveys at baseline and post-intervention  which will be compared with usual practice in the control area, where the current  level of services provided by the government will continue. The primary analysis  will be intention to treat. DISCUSSION: This study will help answer some critical  questions about the effectiveness and feasibility of implementing an mHealth  solution in an area of MNCH services.

AB  - AIMS: The primary objective was to evaluate the impact of the smart phone-based  diabetes management application, Welltang, on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The  second objective was to measure whether Welltang improves blood glucose, low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol, weight, blood pressure, hypoglycemic events, satisfaction  of patients to use Welltang, diabetes knowledge of patients, and self-care  behaviors. METHODS: One hundred evenly randomized subjects with diabetes, aged  18-74years, were recruited from the outpatient Department of Endocrinology for a  3-month study. The Welltang intervention group received training for the use of  Welltang, while the control group received their usual standard of care. HbA1c,  blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, weight, blood pressure,  hypoglycemic events, satisfaction of patients to use Welltang, diabetes knowledge of  patients, and self-care behaviors were measured. Patient data were analyzed using  independent t test and paired sample test using SPSS version 12. RESULTS: The  average decrease in HbA1c was 1.95% (21mmol/mol) in the intervention group and 0.79%  (8mmol/mol) in the control group (P<0.001). Measures of self-monitored blood  glucose, diabetes knowledge, and self-care behaviors improved in patients in the  intervention group. Eighty four percent of patients in the intervention group were  satisfied with the use of Welltang. Differences in hypoglycemic events, low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol, weight, and blood pressure were not statistically  significant. CONCLUSION: Diabetes patients using the Welltang application achieved  statistically significant improvements in HbA1c, blood glucose, satisfaction of  patients to use of Welltang, diabetes knowledge, and self-care behaviors.

AB  - Automation of dietary assessment can reduce limitations of established  methodologies, by alleviating participant and researcher burden. Designed as a  research tool, the electronic Dietary Intake Assessment (e-DIA) is a food record in  mobile phone application format. The present study aimed to examine the relative  validity of the e-DIA with the 24-h recall method to estimate intake of food groups.  A sample of eighty university students aged 19-24 years recorded 5 d of e-DIA and 3  d of recall within this 5-d period. The three matching days of dietary data were  used for analysis. Food intake data were disaggregated and apportioned to one of  eight food groups. Median intakes of food groups were similar between the methods,  and strong correlations were found (mean: 0·79, range: 0·69-0·88).  Cross-classification by tertiles produced a high level of exact agreement (mean: 71  %, range: 65-75 %), and weighted κ values were moderate to good (range: 0·54-0·71).  Although mean differences (e-DIA-recall) were small (range: -13 to 23 g), limits of  agreement (LOA) were relatively large (e.g. for vegetables, mean difference: -4 g,  LOA: -159 to 151 g). The Bland-Altman plots showed robust agreement, with minimum  bias. This analysis supports the use of e-DIA as an alternative to the repeated 24-h  recall method for ranking individuals' food group intake.

AB  - The present study aims to provide electrophysiological evidence for deficient  inhibitory control in problematic mobile phone use and to investigate whether  reduced inhibition is more pronounced during exposure to a mobile phone related  background cue. A screen scale of smartphone addiction was completed by 227 college  students, and finally an experimental group and a control group consisting of 20  problematic mobile phone users and 19 controls were included in the study.  Event-related potentials were recorded during a backgrounded Go/NoGo task performed  by those two groups, in which either a frequent Go signal (letter "M") or a rare  NoGo signal (letter "W") was superimposed on three different background cues:  neutral, mobile phone application-related and mobile phone using-related pictures.  Results showed that problematic mobile phone users performed more commission errors  than controls following mobile phone application background. Furthermore,  problematic mobile phone users displayed a weaker NoGo P3 amplitude than controls on  the mobile phone application background. The result might suggest that there is no  general impairment of inhibitory control in problematic mobile phone use. The  deficient inhibitory control on behavioral and psychophysiological level appeared  merely in the mobile phone-related background. Such deficient stimuli-specific  inhibitory control appears at the late stage of inhibitory control. Prevention  programs should be designed to curtail exposure to the mobile phone-related stimulus  and enhance cognitive control of potential problematic mobile phone users.

AB  - Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has received strong empirical support and is  practiced widely as a treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and BPD  with comorbid substance use disorders (BPD-SUD). Therapeutic success in DBT requires  that individuals generalize newly acquired skills to their natural environment.  However, there have been only a limited number of options available to achieve this  end. The primary goal of this research was to develop and test the feasibility of  the DBT Coach, a software application for a smartphone, designed specifically to  enhance generalization of a specific DBT skill (opposite action) among individuals  with BPD-SUD. We conducted a quasiexperimental study in which 22 individuals who  were enrolled in DBT treatment programs received a smartphone with the DBT Coach for  10 to 14 days and were instructed to use it as needed. Participants used the DBT  Coach an average of nearly 15 times and gave high ratings of helpfulness and  usability. Results indicate that both emotion intensity and urges to use substances  significantly decreased within each coaching session. Furthermore, over the trial  period, participants reported a decrease in depression and general distress. Mobile  technology offering in vivo skills coaching may be a useful tool for reducing urges  to use substances and engage in other maladaptive behavior by directly teaching and  coaching in alternative, adaptive coping behavior.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The sound of running water (SRW) has been effectively used for toilet  training during toddlerhood. However, the effect of SRW on voiding functions in  adult males with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) has not been evaluated. To  determine the effect of SRW on urination in male patients with LUTS, multiple  voiding parameters of uroflowmetry with postvoid residual urine (PVR) were assessed  according to the presence of SRW played by a mobile application. METHODS: Eighteen  consecutive male patients with LUTS were prospectively enrolled between March and  April 2014. Uroflowmetry with PVR measured by a bladder scan was randomly performed  once weekly for two consecutive weeks with and without SRW in a completely sealed  room after pre-checked bladder volume was scanned to be more than 150 cc. SRW was  played with river water sounds amongst relaxed melodies from a smartphone mobile  application. RESULTS: The mean age of enrolled patients and their mean International  Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) were 58.9 ± 7.7 years (range: 46-70) and 13.1 ± 5.9,  respectively. All patients had not been prescribed any medications, including  alpha-blockers or anti-muscarinic agents, in the last 3 months. There was a  significant increase in mean peak flow rate (PFR) with SRW in comparison to without  SRW (15.7 mL/s vs. 12.3 mL/s, respectively, p = 0.0125). However, there were no  differences in other uroflowmetric parameters, including PVR. CONCLUSIONS: The study  showed that SRW from a mobile phone application may be helpful in facilitating  voiding functions by increasing PFR in male LUTS patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This case report aims to (1) describe the development and refinement of a  smartphone application for eating disorder self-monitoring; (2) characterize its  users in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics; and (3) explore its  feasibility and utilization as a self-monitoring tool. METHOD: We developed a mobile  phone application through which people with eating disorders can self-monitor meals,  emotions, behaviors, and thoughts. The application also included positive  reinforcement, coping skill suggestions, social support, and feedback components.  The app was made available on two Internet app stores. Data include number of  downloads and subsequent usage statistics, consumer ratings on app-stores are used  as indicators of satisfaction, anonymous aggregate demographic data and Eating  Disorder Examination Questionnaire scores from 57,940 individuals collected over a  two-year period. RESULTS: The app demonstrated population-level utilization with  over 100,000 users over a two-year period. Almost 50% percent of users stated that  they are not currently receiving clinical treatment and 33% reported they had not  told anyone about their eating disorder. A surprising number of people with severe  problems are using the app. DISCUSSION: Smartphone apps have the capacity to reach  and engage traditionally underserved individuals with eating disorders at a large  scale. Additional work is indicated for the evaluation of the clinical effectiveness  of applications for specific user groups and in clinical treatment contexts.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a pre-existing smartphone app to teach mindfulness  meditation is acceptable to women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and can be  integrated into clinical practice within the National Health Service (NHS) CPP  pathways, and to inform the design of a potential randomised clinical trial. DESIGN:  A prestudy patient and public involvement (PPI) group to collect feedback on the  acceptability of the existing app and study design was followed by a three-arm  randomised feasibility trial. In addition, we undertook interviews and focus groups  with patients and staff to explore app usability and acceptability. We also obtained  participant comments on the research process, such as acceptability of the study  questionnaires. SETTING: Two gynaecology clinics within Barts Health NHS, London,  UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with CPP lasting ≥6 months with access to smartphone or  personal computer and understanding of basic English. INTERVENTION: The intervention  was mindfulness meditation content plus additional pain module delivered by a  smartphone app. Active controls received muscle relaxation content from the same  app. Passive (waiting list) controls received usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:  Themes on user feedback, app usability and integration, and reasons for using/not  using the app. RESULTS: The use of the app was low in both active groups. Patients  in the prestudy PPI group, all volunteers, were enthusiastic about the app  (convenience, content, portability, flexibility, ease of use). Women contributing to  the interview or focus group data (n=14), from a 'real world' clinic (some not  regular app users), were less positive, citing as barriers lack of  opportunities/motivation to use the app and lack of familiarity and capabilities  with technology. Staff (n=7) were concerned about the potential need for extra  support for them and for the patients, and considered the app needed organisational  backing and peer acceptance. CONCLUSION: The opinions of prestudy PPI volunteers  meeting in their private time may not represent those of patients recruited at a  routine clinic appointment. It may be more successful to codesign/codevelop an app  with typical users than to adapt existing apps for use in real-world clinical  populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN10925965.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interest in mindfulness has increased exponentially, particularly in the  fields of psychology and medicine. The trait or state of mindfulness is  significantly related to several indicators of psychological health, and  mindfulness-based therapies are effective at preventing and treating many chronic  diseases. Interest in mobile applications for health promotion and disease  self-management is also growing. Despite the explosion of interest, research on both  the design and potential uses of mindfulness-based mobile applications (MBMAs) is  scarce. OBJECTIVE: Our main objective was to study the features and functionalities  of current MBMAs and compare them to current evidence-based literature in the health  and clinical setting. METHODS: We searched online vendor markets, scientific journal  databases, and grey literature related to MBMAs. We included mobile applications  that featured a mindfulness-based component related to training or daily practice of  mindfulness techniques. We excluded opinion-based articles from the literature.  RESULTS: The literature search resulted in 11 eligible matches, two of which  completely met our selection criteria-a pilot study designed to evaluate the  feasibility of a MBMA to train the practice of "walking meditation," and an  exploratory study of an application consisting of mood reporting scales and  mindfulness-based mobile therapies. The online market search eventually analyzed 50  available MBMAs. Of these, 8% (4/50) did not work, thus we only gathered information  about language, downloads, or prices. The most common operating system was Android.  Of the analyzed apps, 30% (15/50) have both a free and paid version. MBMAs were  devoted to daily meditation practice (27/46, 59%), mindfulness training (6/46, 13%),  assessments or tests (5/46, 11%), attention focus (4/46, 9%), and mixed objectives  (4/46, 9%). We found 108 different resources, of which the most used were reminders,  alarms, or bells (21/108, 19.4%), statistics tools (17/108, 15.7%), audio tracks  (15/108, 13.9%), and educational texts (11/108, 10.2%). Daily, weekly, monthly  statistics, or reports were provided by 37% (17/46) of the apps. 28% (13/46) of them  permitted access to a social network. No information about sensors was available.  The analyzed applications seemed not to use any external sensor. English was the  only language of 78% (39/50) of the apps, and only 8% (4/50) provided information in  Spanish. 20% (9/46) of the apps have interfaces that are difficult to use. No  specific apps exist for professionals or, at least, for both profiles (users and  professionals). We did not find any evaluations of health outcomes resulting from  the use of MBMAs. CONCLUSIONS: While a wide selection of MBMAs seem to be available  to interested people, this study still shows an almost complete lack of evidence  supporting the usefulness of those applications. We found no randomized clinical  trials evaluating the impact of these applications on mindfulness training or health  indicators, and the potential for mobile mindfulness applications remains largely  unexplored.

Nurse researchers, providing creative and  theoretically based approaches for complex client health care, are increasingly  becoming interdisciplinary leaders on research teams. The first purpose of this  article was to describe this interdisciplinary team's development of a cellular  (cell) phone application (app), the Enhanced New Mothers Network (ENMN). The second  purpose of this article was to describe lessons learned by nursing members of the  interdisciplinary team members about developing a cell phone app for delivery of the  ENMN intervention. Interdisciplinary research is beneficial where providing  interventions to assist patients to achieve optimal health outcomes is rarely  dependent on the work of one profession.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of effective medications and clinical  guidelines for pain management, pain control is suboptimal in a sizeable proportion  of patients with cancer pain. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines  recommend a comprehensive and multimodal approach for management of cancer pain. We  developed a mobile phone application, ePAL, based on clinical guidelines to empower  patients for cancer pain management by prompting regular pain assessments and  coaching for self-management. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate  the effect of a multidimensional mobile phone-based pain management application,  ePAL, on controlling cancer pain and improving quality of life in patients with  cancer pain being treated at an academic palliative care clinic. METHODS: The study  will be implemented as a 2-arm randomized controlled trial with 110 adult patients  with CP who own a mobile phone over a follow-up period of two months. Participants  will be randomized to either the intervention group receiving ePAL and usual care or  to a control group receiving only usual care. The brief pain inventory will be used  to assess our primary outcome which is pain intensity. We will also evaluate the  effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes which include the effect of the  intervention on hospital utilization for pain crisis, quality of life, adherence to  analgesic medications, barriers to pain control, anxiety and patient engagement.  Instruments that will be used in evaluating secondary outcomes include the Brief  Pain Inventory, Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, Barriers Questionnaire-II,  Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, Edmonton Symptom Assessment System,  Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, and the Functional Assessment of Chronic  Illness Therapy-Fatigue. The intention-to-treat approach will be used to evaluate  outcomes. Our primary outcome, pain intensity, measured longitudinally over eight  weeks, will be assessed by mixed model repeated analysis. Effect sizes will be  calculated as mean group differences with standard deviations. RESULTS: The study is  still in progress. We hope to have results by the end of 2015. CONCLUSIONS: The  multidimensional approach to pain management implemented on a mobile phone  application could lead to significant improvements in patient outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol misuse remains a major risk factor for contracting sexually  transmitted diseases (STDs) not typically addressed in STD clinic settings.  Information and communication technology (ICT) can offer new avenues to deliver  evidence-based screening and treatment for problematic drinking, however, few data  exists regarding the utilization of ICT among STD clinic attendees with coexisting  drinking problems. The objectives of this study are to identify STD clinics  attendees with hazardous drinking, to examine socio-demographic factors associated  with ICT use, and to explore individuals' interests in engaging in ICT-based health  interventions. METHODS: Cross-sectional questionnaires examining alcohol consumption  and ICT use were administered to 396 persons attending two non-urban STD clinics.  Descriptive statistics for ICT use were calculated for both hazardous drinkers and  the entire sample. Multivariable logistic regression models among hazardous drinkers  identified factors significantly associated with use of each kind of ICT. RESULTS:  The mean age of the 396 participants was 25 years, 66% were females and 60% were  African-Americans. One third of the sample met the criteria of hazardous drinking.  ICT use in hazardous drinkers included 94% reporting having internet access at least  monthly, 82% reporting having an email account, 85% reporting currently owning a  cell phone, and 91% reporting use of any cell phone application. More than two  thirds (73%) of hazardous drinkers were willing to play health-related video games  during clinic waiting time, slightly higher than the entire sample (69%).  Multivariable analyses indicated that younger age were significantly related to  monthly internet use, and multifunction cell phone use, while being males and  younger age were significantly associated with monthly video game playing.  CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates commonality of ICT use among STD clinic  attendees with hazardous drinking, indicating the viability of using ICT to assist  screening and behavioural intervention for alcohol misuse in STD clinic settings.  Future research is needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of ICT-based health  behavioural interventions in the STD clinic settings or other venues that serve  populations at high risk for substance abuse, HIV or other STDs.

AB  - To evaluate comparative efficiency of traditional vs automated colony counting  methods, cultures of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25945), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC  12225), Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC19615) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC49619)  were prepared as pure cultures and mixed cultures at 0·5 McFarland standard and  serial dilutions were performed. Plates were inoculated in triplicate with 50, 125,  250 and 500 colony forming units and counted by four researchers, visually and using  each of the automated counters. Colony count and counting time were recorded. The  pattern of efficiency for all bacterial species was similar: plates with low counts  were accurate and quick to count for all methods, with an increase in time and a  decrease in accuracy and precision as counts rose. Higher counts of single round  colonies required less time and had greater precision with automated counters than  human visual counting counts with no loss of accuracy; however, counts were reduced  in accuracy and increased in time for species with less regular morphology or when  plates had mixed species. Surprisingly, a free phone application was only slightly  less precise and more time consuming than the high-end professional counter  indicating that automation may be achievable at lower cost than expected.  SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Colony quantification is essential in clinical  and research settings as well as pedagogy at the college level. Human visual (HV)  counting, the most common method, is time consuming and fraught with errors. The  time, accuracy and precision of HV counting were compared to a high-end professional  automated counter, an inexpensive phone application and a free phone application.  Low cost benefits of increased speed and accuracy with automated counting are  maximized when counting single round colonies; but much reduced if colonies have  irregular morphology or demonstrate haemolysis.

AB  - Objectives: Smartphone applications ("apps") can be used to promote health behavior  change and expand the reach of behavioral interventions. To date, only a few  existing apps have been developed for health promotion among adolescent survivors of  childhood cancer. To address this gap, we developed an app-based intervention, using  game design characteristics, theory-based behavioral strategies, and assistance from  a health coach to motivate health behavior change for adolescent survivors of  childhood cancer. This article describes the development and initial feasibility  evaluation of the intervention. Methods: Using a theoretical framework and an  extensive formative process, we developed an app-based game ("Mila Blooms") that  promotes healthy eating and physical activity among adolescent survivors of  childhood cancer. A single-arm 8-week intervention, using this app-based game, with  assistance from a health coach, was conducted among a sample of pediatric cancer  survivors (n = 15) to evaluate its initial feasibility for promoting health behavior  change. Results: Results from the feasibility evaluation were encouraging. The  majority of enrolled participants were retained throughout the 8-week intervention  (93.8%). Participant satisfaction feedback indicated positive experiences, related  to ease of use and enjoyment of the app. Although there was little evidence for  behavior change attributable to the app in this first stage of development, there  was a solid demonstration of the viability and appeal of the game features, and  there were no adverse side effects. Conclusions: Results provide insights into how  gamification can be used to promote health behaviors through an app-based  intervention. Mila Blooms holds promise for promoting health behavior change.  Lessons learned from our experiences could be useful for the future development and  implementation of app-based adolescent health interventions.

AB  - DNA imaging techniques using optical microscopy have found numerous applications in  biology, chemistry and physics and are based on relatively expensive, bulky and  complicated set-ups that limit their use to advanced laboratory settings. Here we  demonstrate imaging and length quantification of single molecule DNA strands using a  compact, lightweight and cost-effective fluorescence microscope installed on a  mobile phone. In addition to an optomechanical attachment that creates a high  contrast dark-field imaging setup using an external lens, thin-film interference  filters, a miniature dovetail stage and a laser-diode for oblique-angle excitation,  we also created a computational framework and a mobile phone application connected  to a server back-end for measurement of the lengths of individual DNA molecules that  are labeled and stretched using disposable chips. Using this mobile phone platform,  we imaged single DNA molecules of various lengths to demonstrate a sizing accuracy  of <1 kilobase-pairs (kbp) for 10 kbp and longer DNA samples imaged over a  field-of-view of ∼2 mm2.

AB  - In developing countries, the deployment of medical diagnostic technologies remains a  challenge because of infrastructural limitations (e.g. refrigeration, electricity),  and paucity of health professionals, distribution centers and transportation  systems. Here we demonstrate the technical development and clinical testing of a  novel electronics enabled microfluidic paper-based analytical device (EE-μPAD) for  quantitative measurement of micronutrient concentrations in decentralized,  resource-limited settings. The system performs immune-detection using paper-based  microfluidics, instrumented with flexible electronics and optoelectronic sensors in  a mechanically robust, ultrathin format comparable in size to a credit card.  Autonomous self-calibration, plasma separation, flow monitoring, timing and data  storage enable multiple devices to be run simultaneously. Measurements are  wirelessly transferred to a mobile phone application that geo-tags the data and  transmits it to a remote server for real time tracking of micronutrient  deficiencies. Clinical tests of micronutrient levels from whole blood samples (n=95)  show comparable sensitivity and specificity to ELISA-based tests. These results  demonstrate instantaneous acquisition and global aggregation of diagnostics data  using a fully integrated point of care system that will enable rapid and distributed  surveillance of disease prevalence and geographical progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies assessed the effect of mobile phone applications on  self-management outcomes in patients with asthma, but all of them presented variable  results. In this paper. we examined the effect of a mobile phone application on  self-management and disease control in Romanian population. METHODS: This study  included 93 patients diagnosed with asthma that were recalled every three months for  a year for assessment and treatment. Patients were divided into two groups. The  first group included patients that received treatment, and the second group received  treatment and also used the smartphone application. Number of exacerbations and  asthma control test (ACT) were recorded. RESULTS: The ACT score was significantly  higher for asthma patients using also the mobile application than for the patients  using the treatment alone, for all the evaluation moments (Mann-Whitney U test,  p <  0.001). Also, we found significant differences between the ACT score with-in  each group, observing a significant improvement of the score between evaluations and  baseline (related-samples Friedman's test with Bonferroni correction, p <  0.001).  When considering the exacerbations rate, significantly less patients using the  application presented exacerbations, 10.30% vs. 46.30% (Pearson Chi-square test,  X(2) (1) = 13.707, p <  0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that smartphone  applications are an effective way to improve asthma control and self-management when  used continually in our population. We found significant positive effects in disease  control and exacerbation frequency.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Software to help control diabetes is currently an embryonic market with  the main activity to date focused mainly on the development of noncomputerized  solutions, such as cardboard calculators or computerized solutions that use "flat"  computer models, which are applied to each person without taking into account their  individual lifestyles. The development of true, mobile device-driven health  applications has been hindered by the lack of tools available in the past and the  sheer lack of mobile devices on the market. This has now changed, however, with the  availability of pocket personal computer handsets. METHOD: This article describes a  solution in the form of an intelligent neural network running on mobile devices,  allowing people with diabetes access to it regardless of their location. Utilizing  an easy to learn and use multipanel user interface, people with diabetes can run the  software in real time via an easy to use graphical user interface. The neural  network consists of four neurons. The first is glucose. If the user's current  glucose level is within the target range, the glucose weight is then multiplied by  zero. If the glucose level is high, then there will be a positive value multiplied  to the weight, resulting in a positive amount of insulin to be injected. If the  user's glucose level is low, then the weights will be multiplied by a negative  value, resulting in a decrease in the overall insulin dose. RESULTS: A  minifeasibility trial was carried out at a local hospital under a consultant  endocrinologist in Belfast. The short study ran for 2 weeks with six patients. The  main objectives were to investigate the user interface, test the remote sending of  data over a 3G network to a centralized server at the university, and record patient  data for further proofing of the neural network. We also received useful feedback  regarding the user interface and the feasibility of handing real-world patients a  new mobile phone. Results of this short trial confirmed to a large degree that our  approach (which also can be known as intensive insulinotherapy) has value and  perhaps that our neural network approach has implications for future intelligent  insulin pumps. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is no software available to tell people  with diabetes how much insulin to inject in accordance with their lifestyle and  individual inputs, which leads to adjustments in software predictions on the amount  of insulin to inject. We have taken initial steps to supplement the knowledge and  skills of health care professionals in controlling insulin levels on a daily basis  using a mobile device for people who are less able to manage their disease,  especially children and young adults.

AU  - Kazikdas, Kadir Cagdas
T2  - Ear, nose, & throat journal
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the novel use of sleep monitoring  applications in simple snorers undergoing concha radiofrequency surgery and to  compare and correlate the pre- and postoperative symptoms of these patients using  the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale. In this retrospective  analysis, we have selected 18 consecutive patients with no comorbid sleep or medical  disorders suffering from chronic nasal blockage and habitual snoring due to isolated  submucous inferior turbinate hyperplasia. After a median follow-up of 8.3 months,  the NOSE scale and snoring sound intensity levels monitored by the smart phone  application showed statistically significant improvements after the surgical  procedure ( P < .05), and we also detected a positive correlation between the levels  of snoring percentage and the total NOSE scores ( P < .05). We hypothesize that  sleep monitoring applications could be easily used as portable monitors for basic  home sleep studies in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation.  Alternatively, such applications may simply be used for objective monitoring of the  postoperative success of surgical interventions in the upper respiratory tract  region such as concha reduction surgeries as presented herein.

AB  - The prevalence of chronic diseases among middle aged males outweigh their female  counterparts in developed countries. To prevent this, delivery of health promotion  programs targeting lifestyle modifications of physical activity and nutrition in  middle-aged males has been essential, but often difficult. ManUp health promotion  program was a recent initiative that uses current advances in information and  communication technology (ICT) to reach the middle-aged males. One of the key  components of the ICT approach was the development of smartphone application to  enable middle-aged men to uptake the program with their own mobile phone. The smart  phone application was aimed at providing varied level of challenges towards physical  activity and healthy eating behavior, with interactive and motivational feedback SMS  messages. The ManUp program was recently implemented and trialed in a randomized  control trial in Gladstone and Rockhampton, Queens. This paper describes the  components of the smart phone application integrated within the ManUp health  promotion program.

AB  - PURPOSE: This is a feasibility study assessing use of a mobile phone application  (app.) to measure nutrient intake relevant to age-related macular degeneration  (AMD). METHODS: Inclusion criteria were age over 40 and ownership of a smartphone.  Participants included healthy volunteers and those with ophthalmic conditions. They  were asked to record daily food intake for a minimum of 3 days in a paper food diary  and the app. A dietician analyzed the food diaries, and an independent researcher  analyzed data from the app. Average daily intake of nutrients relevant to AMD  (docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], vitamins E and C, copper,  zinc, and lutein + zeaxanthin) were calculated for both and then compared. RESULTS:  A total of 54 participants completed the app. and food diary. Male-to-female ratio  was 7:20. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 57 years (45.3-68.7 years).  More than 90% of all values were within the limits of agreement for all  micronutrients. Bland Altman agreement plots demonstrated clinically acceptable  agreement between the two systems of analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study has  demonstrated that the app. is a feasible alternative to the food diary for assessing  nutrient intake relevant to AMD. Further studies are suggested to assess long-term  adherence and effect of the app. on nutrient intake in AMD patients. TRANSLATIONAL  RELEVANCE: After smoking, nutritional modification is the key modifiable factor to  reduce incidence of AMD. Use of the app. could be an efficient, easy way to monitor  and improve dietary intake of required nutrients pertinent to AMD.

AB  - Although daily hassles and coping are associated with behavior and emotional  problems in non-clinical populations, few studies have investigated these  relationships in individuals with high-functioning autism/Asperger's Disorder  (HFASD). This study examined the relationships between daily hassles, coping and  behavior and emotional problems in adolescents with HFASD. Thirty-one adolescents  with HFASD completed questionnaires assessing their coping and behavior and  emotional problems, and completed an Ecological Momentary Assessment run via a  mobile phone application on their coping and daily hassles. Parents completed  questionnaires of the adolescents' daily hassles, coping, and behavior and emotional  problems. The disengagement coping style was associated with significantly higher  levels of behavior and emotional problems regardless of respondent or methodology,  suggesting it may be a valuable target for intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The re-emergence of the HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men  (MSM) represents a serious health issue. This study aimed to assess the HIV  prevalence among MSM in a very low prevalence population of a large city. METHODS: A  public campaign to raise awareness of HIV infection and to provide access to  anonymous testing was conducted in places frequented by MSM and through a mobile  phone application. No identity information was requested from individuals contacting  the call centre, and anonymous and free HIV testing was offered proactively. Those  who agreed to have a test were provided a code number, which was used in blood  sampling procedures. RESULTS: Of 1200 subjects who contacted the call centre, 197  consented to undergo HIV testing and visited the laboratory to give a blood sample.  Twenty-five subjects were found to have a reactive ELISA result on two different  occasions plus a positive Western blot test result. Thus, the HIV prevalence in this  group of MSM was 12.7%. CONCLUSIONS: MSM remain a high risk group for HIV infection  in a low prevalence setting, and thus represent a key target population for  diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: "The graying of the globe" has resulted in exponential rise in health  care expenses, over-worked health care professionals and a growing patient base  suffering from multiple chronic diseases, one of which is diabetes. Consumer health  technologies (CHT) are considered important catalysts for empowering health care  consumers to take a proactive role in managing their health and related costs.  Adoption rate and usability of such devices among the aging is far from being  satisfactory. Past studies noted the motivation for adoption by the aging is  dependent on the suitability/relevance, perceived usability and anticipated benefits  associated with usage of technological innovation. Traditional information  technology (IT) development adopts a systematic approach without necessarily using a  specific user model that personalizes the system to the aging user groups. The aging  patient population has unique needs arising from progressive deterioration in both  physiological and psychological abilities. These needs are often ignored in the  design, development, trial and adoption of consumer health products resulting in low  adoption and usage. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this research is to  investigate the user-centered design (UCD), specifically user profiles and personas,  as methodological tools to inform the design and development of CHT devices for an  aging population. The adoption of user profile and persona has not received much  attention in health care informatics research and, in particular, research involving  CHT. Our work begins to fill this void in three ways. We (1) illuminate the process  of developing CHT user profiles and personas for a Chinese elder population with a  demanding health care needs, i.e., self-management of chronic diabetes, with the  hope that the resulting profiles and personas may be used as foundational material  for informing the design, development and evaluation of CHT in other similar  contexts; (2) call attention to how to further enhance and complement traditional  user profile and persona techniques for CHT design by integrating cognitive  structures and present behavior that drive health care thinking, future behavior and  demand; (3) show how the profiles and personas can be used to inform requirements,  design and implementation decisions for a technology aimed at facilitating CHT  adoption and diffusion for the elderly. METHODOLOGY: To exemplify process and  application, we use an action-research methodology, where user profiles and personas  of an aging patient population were developed. The resultant profiles and personas  were leveraged to improve the design, development and implementation plans of a  smart phone application to assist chronically ill aging Chinese diabetic population  capable of disease self-management. RESULTS: The results from the study show that  user profile and persona can be a valuable methodological approach in capturing the  conceptual model of the aging and informing the design and development decisions of  CHT. The demonstration of techniques used in this study can serve as a guideline to  CHT developers in bringing conceptual user modeling into the design of software  interfaces targeted for users with specific health care needs. Specifically, the  study provides guidance on the creation and use of profiles and personas to tap into  the conceptual models of the targeted elderly population reflecting their  preferences, capabilities and attitudes towards using technology in self-management  care in general and the smart phone diabetes management application in particular.  Insight into the mental model of the aging group has been shown to inform later  stages of UCD development (e.g., the creation of prototypes and usability testing)  as well as implementation and adoption strategies. The World Health Organization  (WHO) predicts that by 2025, 80% of all new cases of diabetes are expected to appear  in the developing countries. In fact, the number of diabetic patients in China is  estimated to rise to 42.3 million in 2030 from 20.8 million in 2000. Thus, we  investigate the Chinese aging population in order to demonstrate the process of  developing and using user profile and persona. We hope that the resultant conceptual  model of the Chinese aging diabetic population can be used in future research to  guide CHT designers interested in designing health care devices for this vulnerable  user group.

AB  - Non-adherence to self-management poses a serious risk to diabetes complications.  Digital behavioural change interventions have the potential to provide education and  motivate users to regularly engage with self-management of diabetes. This paper  describes the development of My Care Hub mobile phone application (app) aimed at  supporting self-management in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The development  of My Care Hub involved a comprehensive process of healthy behavioural change  identification, end users' needs, expert consensus, data security and privacy  considerations. The app translation was a highly iterative process accompanied by  usability testing and design modification. The app development process included: (1)  behaviour change strategy selection; (2) users' involvement; (3) expert advisory  involvement; (4) data security and privacy considerations; (5) design creation and  output translation into a smartphone app and (6) two usability testings of the app  prototype version. The app features include self-management activities  documentation, analytics, personalized and generalized messages for diabetes  self-management as well as carbohydrate components of common foods in Australia.  Twelve respondents provided feedback on the usability of the app. Initially, a  simplification of the documentation features of the app was identified as a need to  improve usability. Overall, results indicated good user satisfaction rate.

AB  - The last 30 years has seen an increase in environmental, socio-economic, and  recreational objectives being considered throughout the forest planning process. In  the Finnish context these are considered mainly at the regional level potentially  missing out on more local issues and problems. Such local information would be most  efficiently collected with a participatory GIS approach. A mobile participatory GIS  application called Tienoo was developed as a tool for collecting location-specific  opinions of recreational and aesthetical characteristics of forests and forest  management. The application also contains information the user can access regarding  the practical details of the area, for instance about the recreational  infrastructure. The application was tested in Ruunaa National Hiking Area, North  Karelia, Eastern Finland. Through this application it is possible to continuously  collect geolocated preference information. As a result, the collected opinions have  details which can be located in both time and space. This allows for the possibility  to monitor the changes in opinions when the stands are treated, and it also allows  for easily analyzing the effect of time of year on the opinions. It is also possible  to analyze the effect of the spatial location and the forest characteristics on the  opinions using GIS analysis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Research has shown that mobile phones can help with management of  numerous health problems. As an adjunct to care management provided to injured  service members rehabilitating in their communities, particularly those with mild  traumatic brain injury (mTBI), post-traumatic stress (PTS), and/or behavioral health  problems, the Army developed a mobile phone application called "mCare." This study  examined whether service members who received mCare had higher well-being, were more  satisfied with their care, and viewed mCare as a valuable part of their care  management as compared with their counterparts who received standard care management  alone, and whether those with mTBI, PTS, and/or behavioral health problems benefited  differently from mCare. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In-processing service members at four  community-based warrior transition units were recruited for participation in a  36-wk, randomized, controlled trial and allocated to receive standard care  management plus mCare (n = 95) or standard care management alone (n = 87).  Participants in the mCare group received daily questionnaires, tips, and appointment  reminders. All participants were asked to complete the General Well-being Schedule  (GWS) at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 wk, and the Case Management Quality Questionnaire  (CMQQ) at 12, 24, and 36 wk. All participants and care managers were approached to  complete interviews about the usability/likeability of mCare or standard care  management. The analyses tested for group differences in completion of the  intervention, graphed means for the GWS and CMQQ by group/subgroup, and  statistically compared the longitudinal trends in these outcomes using mixed models  in which group, time, and group*time were included as regression variables. The  analyses also tallied interview responses and identified thematic quotes. The study  protocol was reviewed and approved by the Walter Reed National Military Medical  Center's Institutional Review Board. RESULTS: Estimated rate of change in GWS scores  was -2.2 (standard error = 1.0; t = -2.1; p = 0.0382). Estimated rate of change in  CMQQ scores was -0.8 (standard error = 0.5; t = -1.52; p = 0.1299). Neither change  was meaningful. Rates of change in the GWS and CMQQ scores did not differ by group  or by behavioral health, mTBI, and PTS subgroups within the groups. The interviews  found that 83% of mCare participants liked the communication with their care  managers versus 73% of standard care management participants. Participants in both  the mCare group and the care managers said that they liked the application's  appointment tracking and reminders. Care managers thought mCare was particularly  useful for people with mTBI, PTS, and cognitive problems. CONCLUSION: mCare did not  result in differences in general well-being and satisfaction with care management  among service members rehabilitating in their communities, some with mTBI, PTS,  and/or behavioral health problems. But participants and care managers who used mCare  said that they found it useful. Study limitations included the diversity of clinical  issues of the participants, greater missing data among mCare participants, and the  high baseline quality of care management in the settings observed. The fact that  patients and care managers liked mCare, apart from no changes in outcomes, is  important because health care is increasingly adopting mobile solutions.

AB  - We report the case in order to examine the effect of a mobile application program  ("Diabetes & Nutrition") developed in 2011-2012 for self-management in patients with  type 2 diabetes and to recommend important considerations when the mobile  application program is developed. A 46-year-old man was newly diagnosed with type 2  diabetes in 2013 and had no complications. The height of the patient was 168 cm and  the body weight was 75.6 kg. Nutrition education was conducted according to a  medical prescription, and follow-up nutrition education was conducted after 3 and 6  months. After nutrition education, the patient was engaged in self-management using  "Diabetes & Nutrition" program during 3 months. At 3 months, the body weight had  decreased by 4.4 kg (from 75.6 to 71.2 kg), waist circumference by 5 cm (from 88 to  83 cm) and HbA1c level from 7.9% to 6.1%. Also at 3 months, the medication was  reduced from from the dose of 850 mg to the dose of 500 mg metformin per twice a  day. Since then, the patient did not continue to use the "Diabetes & Nutrition"  because the level of blood glucose had stabilized, and the patient felt inconvenient  and annoying to use the program. At 6 months, no significant change in the body  weight and body composition was observed in comparison with those at 3 months. The  present case demonstrates that the early use of "Diabetes & Nutrition" could be  helpful for self-management of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.  Developing self-management mobile application programs in the future will require  strategies of how to promote continuous use of application program and  self-management of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Asthma is a chronic disease and a growing health problem worldwide. The objective of  this pilot study was to test the feasibility and utilization of tracking asthma  symptoms through an innovative mobile phone application. The subjects for this  research project consisted of 4 individuals who are currently receiving treatment  for asthma from a primary care physician in Ingham County, Michigan. Participants  took their peak flow reading each day and used the short message service (SMS)  function on their phone and sent it to a Web server. If they did not send it by 11  AM, they received a reminder via an automated SMS to their phone. The resulting data  suggest that this method of management is feasible. The data also demonstrate  participants' satisfaction in monitoring their asthma in this manner. Using mobile  phones for asthma management could improve compliance with asthma action plans and  reduce adverse asthma events. Future research could further demonstrate that mobile  phones are a new and effective method for providing healthcare.

AB  - [Purpose] This study investigated the effect of different leg angles during push-up  plus exercise on shoulder stabilization muscle activity. [Participants and Methods]  Fifteen healthy adult males participated in this study. The smart phone application  Clinometer was used to measure leg angles of 70°, 90°, and 110° during push-up plus  exercise. The muscle activities of the serratus anterior, upper trapezius fibers,  and pectoralis major muscles involved in shoulder stabilization were analyzed using  surface electromyogram. [Results] Leg angle significantly affected serratus anterior  muscle activity, but it did not affect activities of the upper trapezius fibers or  pectoralis major muscles. Post-hoc analysis revealed that serratus anterior muscle  activity at the leg angle of 110° was significantly higher than at leg angles of 70°  and 90°. [Conclusion] A higher leg angle during push-up plus exercise is a more  effective intervention for the serratus anterior muscle activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persons with type 1 diabetes who use electronic self-help tools, most  commonly blood glucose meters, record a large amount of data about their personal  condition. Mobile phones are powerful and ubiquitous computers that have a potential  for data analysis, and the purpose of this study is to explore how self-gathered  data can help users improve their blood glucose management. SUBJECTS AND METHODS:  Thirty patients with insulin-regulated type 1 diabetes were equipped with a mobile  phone application for 3-6 months, recording blood glucose, insulin, dietary  information, physical activity, and disease symptoms. The data were analyzed in  terms of usage of the different modules and which data processing and visualization  tools could be constructed to support the use of these data. RESULTS: Eighteen  patients (denoted "adopters") recorded complete data for over 80 consecutive days,  up to 247 days. Among those who withdrew or did not use the application extensively,  the most common reasons given were outdated or difficult-to-use phone. Data analysis  using period finding and scale-space trends was found to yield significant patterns  for most adopters. Pattern recognition methods to predict low or high blood glucose  were found to be performing poorly. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally intrusive mobile  applications enable users with type 1 diabetes to record data that can provide  data-driven feedback to the user, potentially providing relevant insight into their  disease.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to cross-validate the ithlete™ heart rate  variability smart phone application with an electrocardiograph for determining  ultra-short-term root mean square of successive R-R intervals. The root mean square  of successive R-R intervals was simultaneously determined via electrocardiograph and  ithlete™ at rest in twenty five healthy participants. There were no significant  differences between the electrocardiograph and ithlete™ derived root mean square of  successive R-R interval values (p > 0.05) and the correlation was near perfect (r =  0.99, p < 0.001). In addition, the ithlete™ revealed a Standard Error of the  Estimate of 1.47 and Bland Altman plot showed that the limits of agreement ranged  from 2.57 below to 2.63 above the constant error of -0.03. In conclusion, the  ithlete™ appeared to provide a suitably accurate measure of root mean square of  successive R-R intervals when compared to the electrocardiograph measures obtained  in the laboratory within the current sample of healthy adult participants. The  current study lays groundwork for future research determining the efficacy of  ithlete™ for reflecting athletic training status over a chronic conditioning period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluates a mobile phone self monitoring tool designed to  assist paediatricians in assessing and managing youth mental health. METHODS:  Patients from an adolescent outpatient clinic monitored mental health symptoms  throughout each day for 2-4 weeks. Paediatricians specialising in adolescent health  and participants reviewed the collated data displayed online and completed  quantitative and qualitative feedback. RESULTS: Forty-seven adolescents and six  paediatricians participated. Completion was high, with 91% of entries completed in  the first week. Paediatricians found the program helpful for 92% of the participants  and understood 88% of their patients' functioning better. Participants reported the  data reflected their actual experiences (88%) and was accurate (85%), helpful (65%)  and assisted their paediatrician to understand them better (77%). Qualitative  results supported these findings. DISCUSSION: Self monitoring facilitates  communication of mental health issues between these paediatricians and patients and  is a promising tool for the assessment and management of mental health problems in  young people.

T2  - BMJ open
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine how the breastfeeding experience is represented by users of  FeedFinder (a mobile phone application for finding, reviewing and sharing places to  breastfeed in public). DESIGN: Content analysis using FeedFinder database. SETTING:  FeedFinder, UK, September 2013-June 2015. METHODS: Reviews obtained through  FeedFinder over a period of 21 months were systematically coded using a conventional  content analysis approach, average review scores were calculated for the rating  criteria in FeedFinder (comfort, hygiene, privacy, baby facilities) and review texts  were analysed for sentiment. We used data from Foursquare to describe the type of  venues visited and cross-referenced the location of venues with the Indices of  Multiple Deprivation. RESULTS: A total of 1757 reviews were analysed. Of all the  reviews obtained, 80% of those were classified as positive, 15.4% were classified as  neutral and 4.3% were classified as negative. Important factors that were discussed  by women include facilities, service, level of privacy available and qualities of a  venue. The majority of venues were classified as cafes (26.4%), shops (24.4%) and  pubs (13.4%). Data on IMD were available for 1229 venues mapped within FeedFinder,  23% were located within the most deprived quintile and 16% were located in the least  deprived quintile. CONCLUSIONS: Women create content that is positive and  informative when describing their breastfeeding experience in public. Public health  bodies and business owners have the potential to use the data from FeedFinder to  impact on service provision. Further work is needed to explore the demographic  differences that may help to tailor public health interventions aimed at increasing  breastfeeding rates in the UK.

AB  - Immunization saves millions of lives against vaccine-preventable diseases. Yet, 24  million children born every year do not receive proper immunization during their  first year. UNICEF and WHO have emphasized the need to strengthen the immunization  surveillance and monitoring in developing countries to reduce childhood deaths. In  this regard, we present a software application called Jeev to track the vaccination  coverage of children in rural communities. Jeev synergistically combines the power  of smartphones and the ubiquity of cellular infrastructure, QR codes, and national  identification cards. We present the design of Jeev and highlight its unique  features along with a detailed evaluation of its performance and power consumption  using the National Immunization Survey datasets. We are in discussion with a  non-profit organization in Haiti to pilot test Jeev in order to study its  effectiveness and identify socio-cultural issues that may arise in a large-scale  deployment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health (m-health) tools are a promising strategy to facilitate  the work of community health workers (CHWs) in low- and middle-income countries  (LMICs). Despite their potential value, little is known about CHWs' experiences  working with m-health tools in their outreach activities with community members.  METHODS: To understand the benefits of and barriers to using m-health tools for  CHWs, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 57 CHWs employed in six primary  care centers in São Paulo, Brazil. All CHWs had experience using a cell phone  application called Geohealth for collecting health and demographic data of community  members. We assessed their experiences using Geohealth and recommendations for  improvements. RESULTS: CHWs described key benefits of using Geohealth as helping  them save time with bureaucratic paperwork, organizing the data that they needed to  collect, and by replacing sheaves of paper, reducing the weight that they carried in  the field. However, there were many technical and social barriers to the successful  adoption of the m-health tool. Key among these were poor quality hardware, faulty  software programs, and negative community member perceptions of the m-health  program. The CHWs provided valuable input as to how Geohealth could be improved to  fit their needs. CONCLUSION: m-health tools have the potential to facilitate the  work of CHWs in LMICs. However, such tools must be designed and implemented  thoughtfully. Technical barriers related to both hardware and software must be  anticipated and addressed to maximize their efficiency and successful adoption. CHW  input on the design of the tool should be sought to maximize its utility and  minimize barriers to use.

AB  - This article presents the feasibility and acceptability of using mobile health  technology by community health workers (CHWs) in San Juan Province, Dominican  Republic, to improve identification of pregnancy complications and access to care  for pregnant women. Although most women in the Dominican Republic receive four  antenatal care visits, poor women and adolescents in remote areas are more likely to  have only one initial prenatal visit to verify the pregnancy. This community-based  research began when community leaders raised concern about the numbers of their  mothers who died in childbirth annually; San Juan's maternal mortality rate is  144/100,000 compared to the Caribbean rate of 85/100,000. Eight CHWs in three  communities were taught to provide third-trimester antenatal assessment, upload the  data on a mobile phone application, send the data to the local physician who  monitored data for "red flags," and call directly if a mother had an urgent problem.  Fifty-two pregnant women enrolled, 38 were followed to delivery, 95 antenatal care  postintake were provided, 2 urgent complications required CHW home management of  mothers, and there were 0 deaths. Stakeholders endorsed acceptability of  intervention. Preliminary data suggest CHWs using mobile health technology is  feasible, linking underserved and formal health care systems with provision of  primary care in mothers' homes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditionally, assessment of psychiatric symptoms has been relying on  their retrospective report to a trained interviewer. The emergence of smartphones  facilitates passive sensor-based monitoring and active real-time monitoring through  time-stamped prompts; however there are few validated self-report measures designed  for this purpose. METHODS: We introduce a novel, compact questionnaire, Mood Zoom  (MZ), embedded in a customised smart-phone application. MZ asks participants to rate  anxiety, elation, sadness, anger, irritability and energy on a 7-point Likert scale.  For comparison, we used four standard clinical questionnaires administered to  participants weekly to quantify mania (ASRM), depression (QIDS), anxiety (GAD-7),  and quality of life (EQ-5D). We monitored 48 Bipolar Disorder (BD), 31 Borderline  Personality Disorders (BPD) and 51 Healthy control (HC) participants to study  longitudinal (median±iqr: 313±194 days) variation and differences of mood traits by  exploring the data using diverse time-series tools. RESULTS: MZ correlated well  (|R|>0.5,p<0.0001) with QIDS, GAD-7, and EQ-5D. We found statistically strong  (|R|>0.3,p<0.0001) differences in variability in all questionnaires for the three  cohorts. Compared to HC, BD and BPD participants exhibit different trends and  variability, and on average had higher self-reported scores in mania, depression,  and anxiety, and lower quality of life. In particular, analysis of MZ variability  can differentiate BD and BPD which was not hitherto possible using the weekly  questionnaires. LIMITATIONS: All reported scores rely on self-assessment; there is a  lack of ongoing clinical assessment by experts to validate the findings.  CONCLUSIONS: MZ could be used for efficient, long-term, effective daily monitoring  of mood instability in clinical psychiatric practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cameroon still has relatively high maternal mortality rate (MMR) of  596/100,000 live births. Approximately 40% of births are unattended by skilled  healthcare personnel with high out-of-pocket expenditures. Poor resource allocation,  poorly functioning referral systems, long trekking distances to health facilities,  all of which lead to low rates of use of maternal health services. OBJECTIVES: The  aim of this pilot study is to explore perception and acceptability of mobile health  (mhealth) and e-voucher and to determine the feasibility of conducting a large  cluster randomized trial to determine the effects of combining e-vouchers and a  mobile application compared with usual care in improving access to and use of  maternal health services. METHODS: This is a multimethod study that comprises two  phases. The first phase is the development of the mobile phone app, which includes a  qualitative formative study through in-depth key informant interviews and focus  group discussions. The second phase is a cluster randomized control trial assessing  the combination of e-vouchers and a mobile application compared with usual care in  improving access to and use of maternal health services. Feasibility will be  determined based on evaluating randomization, contamination, enrollment rate,  complete follow up, compliance rate, success in matching data from different  sources, and data completeness. ETHICS AND DISCUSSION: Ethics approval has been  granted, and the trial has been registered in the Pan-African Clinical Trials  Registry. We will disseminate our findings through peer-reviewed manuscripts and  conference presentations. Findings from this study will inform the design and  conduct of a larger randomized trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PACTR201808703097367. The  trial on the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The HIV epidemiology in South Africa reveals stark age and gender  disparities, with young women being the most vulnerable to HIV acquisition in 2017.  Evaluation of HIV exposure is a challenge in HIV prevention research. Intermittent  in-clinic interviewer-administered risk behaviour assessments are utilised but may  be limited by social desirability and recall biases. We piloted a mobile phone  application for daily self-report of sexual risk behaviour in fifty 18-25 year old  women at risk of HIV infection enrolled in HIV Vaccine Trials Network 915 (HVTN 915)  in Soweto, South Africa. Through a mixed-methods investigation, we explored barriers  and facilitators to completing daily mobile phone surveys among HVTN 915 study  participants and staff. METHODS: We analysed quantitative data on barriers and  facilitators to mobile phone study completion collected during the larger HVTN 915  study as well as two post-study focus group discussions (FGDs) with fifteen former  participants with a median age of 24 years (IQR 23-25) and six individual in-depth  interviews (IDIs) with HVTN 915 staff. FGDs and IDIs utilised semi-structured  interview guides, were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated to  English. After coding, thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS: The main  facilitator for daily mobile phone survey completion assessed across 336 follow-up  visits for 49 participants was the daily short message system (SMS) reminders (93%,  312/336). Across 336 visits, 31/49 (63%) retained participants reported barriers to  completion of daily mobile phone surveys: forgetting (20%, 12/49), being too busy  (19%, 11/49) and the survey being an inconvenience (15%, 9/49). Five main themes  were identified during the coding of IDIs and FGDs: (1) facilitators of mobile phone  survey completion, such as daily SMS reminders and follow up calls for  non-completers; (2) barriers to mobile phone survey completion, including partner,  time-related and technical barriers; (3) power of incentives; (4) response bias in  providing sensitive information, and (5) recommendations for future mobile phone  based interventions. CONCLUSION: Despite our enthusiasm to use innovation to  optimise sexual risk assessments, technical and practical solutions are required to  improve implementation. We recommend further engagement with participants to  optimise this approach and to further understand social desirability bias and study  incentives in sexual risk reporting.

AB  - Personal Health Intervention Toolkit (PHIT) is an advanced cross-platform software  framework targeted at personal self-help research on mobile devices. Following the  subjective and objective measurement, assessment, and plan methodology for health  assessment and intervention recommendations, the PHIT platform lets researchers  quickly build mobile health research Android and iOS apps. They can (1) create  complex data-collection instruments using a simple extensible markup language (XML)  schema; (2) use Bluetooth wireless sensors; (3) create targeted self-help  interventions based on collected data via XML-coded logic; (4) facilitate  cross-study reuse from the library of existing instruments and interventions such as  stress, anxiety, sleep quality, and substance abuse; and (5) monitor longitudinal  intervention studies via daily upload to a Web-based dashboard portal. For  physiological data, Bluetooth sensors collect real-time data with on-device  processing. For example, using the BinarHeartSensor, the PHIT platform processes the  heart rate data into heart rate variability measures, and plots these data as  time-series waveforms. Subjective data instruments are user data-entry screens,  comprising a series of forms with validation and processing logic. The PHIT  instrument library consists of over 70 reusable instruments for various domains  including cognitive, environmental, psychiatric, psychosocial, and substance abuse.  Many are standardized instruments, such as the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification  Test, Patient Health Questionnaire-8, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist.  Autonomous instruments such as battery and global positioning system location  support continuous background data collection. All data are acquired using a  schedule appropriate to the app's deployment. The PHIT intelligent virtual advisor  (iVA) is an expert system logic layer, which analyzes the data in real time on the  device. This data analysis results in a tailored app of interventions and other  data-collection instruments. For example, if a user anxiety score exceeds a  threshold, the iVA might add a meditation intervention to the task list in order to  teach the user how to relax, and schedule a reassessment using the anxiety  instrument 2 weeks later to re-evaluate. If the anxiety score exceeds a higher  threshold, then an advisory to seek professional help would be displayed. Using the  easy-to-use PHIT scripting language, the researcher can program new instruments, the  iVA, and interventions to their domain-specific needs. The iVA, instruments, and  interventions are defined via XML files, which facilities rapid app development and  deployment. The PHIT Web-based dashboard portal provides the researcher access to  all the uploaded data. After a secure login, the data can be filtered by criteria  such as study, protocol, domain, and user. Data can also be exported into a  comma-delimited file for further processing. The PHIT framework has proven to be an  extensible, reconfigurable technology that facilitates mobile data collection and  health intervention research. Additional plans include instrument development in  other domains, additional health sensors, and a text messaging notification system.

AB  - We evaluated a mobile phone application (Nutricam) for recording dietary intake. It  allowed users to capture a photograph of food items before consumption and store a  voice recording to explain the contents of the photograph. This information was then  sent to a website where it was analysed by a dietitian. Ten adults with type 2  diabetes (BMI 24.1-47.9 kg/m(2)) recorded their intake over a three-day period using  both Nutricam and a written food diary. Compared to the food diary, energy intake  was under-recorded by 649 kJ (SD 810) using the mobile phone method. However, there  was no trend in the difference between dietary assessment methods at levels of low  or high energy intake. All subjects reported that the mobile phone system was easy  to use. Six subjects found that the time taken to record using Nutricam was shorter  than recording using the written diary, while two reported that it was about the  same. The level of detail provided in the voice recording and food items obscured in  photographs reduced the quality of the mobile phone records. Although some  modifications to the mobile phone method will be necessary to improve the accuracy  of self-reported intake, the system was considered an acceptable alternative to  written records and has the potential to be used by adults with type 2 diabetes for  monitoring dietary intake by a dietitian.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphones have become ubiquitous in China, offering a promising way to  deliver mental health interventions; however, little is known about the current use  and characteristics of smartphone apps for mental health. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of  this study was to gain insight into mobile mental health apps available in China as  of December 2018. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify and  evaluate the most downloaded apps from iOS and Android platforms. Apps were  categorized according to their main purpose and downloaded to evaluate their  content. Each app's affiliation, cost, target users, information security, and  evidence-based nature were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 172 unique apps that were  identified, there were 37 apps (21.5%) for psychological counseling, 50 apps (29.1%)  for assessment, 12 apps (7.0%) to relieve stress, 24 apps (14.0%) for  psychoeducation, and 49 (28.4%) multipurpose apps (ie, a combination of counseling  and assessment). Most apps were developed for adults in the general population  (166/172, 96.5%), rather than for psychiatric patients. App-based counseling was  mostly provided by psychologists, and of the assessed apps, only 40% (70/172) used  evidence-based scales to assess mental health problems such as anxiety or depressed  mood. Guided meditation was used as the main technique in stress-relieving apps.  CONCLUSIONS: Many apps contained useful and evidence-based elements, such as good  quality information, validated measurements, and useful meditation methods; however,  for mobile apps to contribute significantly to mental health care in China,  considerable challenges remain, including the need for more patient-focused apps  that can actually take on the role of a health care provider. In addition, efficacy  studies are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Reproducible outcomes in clinical trials depend on adherence to  study protocol. Short message service (also known as text message) reminders have  been shown to improve clinical trial adherence in the United States and elsewhere.  However, due to systematic differences in mobile data plans, languages, and  technology, these systems are not easily translated to international settings.  METHODS: To gauge technical capabilities for international projects, we developed  SMSMessenger, an automated Android application that uses a US server to send  medication reminders to participants in a clinical trial in St. Petersburg, Russia  (Zinc for HIV disease among alcohol users-a randomized controlled trial in the  Russia Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS cohort). The application is  downloaded once onto an Android study phone. When it is time for the text message  reminders to be sent, study personnel access the application on a local phone, which  in turn accesses the existing clinical trial database hosted on a US web server. The  application retrieves a list of participants with the following information: phone  number, whether a message should be received at that time, and the appropriate text  of the message. The application is capable of storing multiple outgoing messages.  With a few clicks, text messages are sent to study participants who can reply  directly to the message. Study staff can check the local phone for incoming  messages. The SMSMessenger application uses an existing clinical trial database and  is able to receive real-time updates. All communications between the application and  server are encrypted, and phone numbers are stored in a secure database behind a  firewall. No sensitive data are stored on the phone, as outgoing messages are sent  through the application and not by messaging features on the phone itself. Messages  are sent simultaneously to study participants, which reduces the burden on local  study staff. Costs and setup are minimal. The only local requirements are an Android  phone and data plan. CONCLUSION: The SMSMessenger technology could be modified to be  applied anywhere in the world, in any language, script, or alphabet, and for many  different purposes. The novel application of this existing low-cost technology can  improve the usefulness of text messaging in advancing the goals of international  clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescents undergoing a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)  experience a variety of adverse effects and eating difficulties. Few interventions  exist to assist patients with self-care after HSCT hospitalization. The Eating After  Transplant (EAT!) program is a mobile phone applications developed to assist  adolescents with self-management of common eating-related issues during HSCT  recovery. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the acceptability and usability of the EAT!  program among adolescents and assessed the competency of the participants using the  program after hospital discharge through the first 100 days after HSCT. METHODS: A  repeated-measures design was used to evaluate the EAT! application with 16  adolescent patients recovering from an allogeneic HSCT. Participants provided verbal  feedback and used a Likert scale to rate acceptability and usability of the  application. In addition, a tracking device monitored use of the application.  Competency was measured with orientation time and independent demonstration of use  of the application. RESULTS: Acceptability remained high throughout the study, but  use significantly decreased over time. Patients reported familiarity with the  program's content as the reason for the declining use. Competency was excellent with  a short orientation period and independent demonstration throughout the study.  CONCLUSIONS: A mobile phone application is a feasible intervention to educate  adolescents with symptom management strategies. Future research needs to examine  factors affecting sustainability of use over time. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:  Healthcare providers need to continue to develop and evaluate innovative methods to  educate adolescents on effective self-care strategies throughout HSCT recovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disparity in utilization of reproductive healthcare services between the  urban poor and the urban non-poor households in the developing nations is well  known. However, disparity may also exist within urban poor households. Our objective  was to document the extent of disparity in reproductive healthcare utilization among  the urban poor and to identify the socio-demographic determinants of  underutilization with a view to characterizing this vulnerable subpopulation.  METHODS: A survey of 16,221 households was conducted in 39 clusters from two large  urban poor settlements in Delhi. From 13,451 consenting households,  socio-demographic data and information on births, maternal and child deaths within  the previous year was collected. Details of antenatal care (ANC) was collected from  597 pregnant women. Information on ANC and postnatal care was also obtained from 596  recently delivered (within six months) mothers. All data were captured  electronically using a customized and validated smart phone application. Households  were categorized into quintiles of socio-economic position (SEP) based on dwelling  characteristics and possession of durable assets using principal component analysis.  Potential socio-demographic determinants of reproductive healthcare utilization were  examined using random effects logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of  facility based birthing was 77% (n = 596 mothers). Of the 596 recently delivered  mothers only 70% had an ANC registration card, 46.3% had ANC in their first  trimester, 46% had visited a facility within 4 weeks post-delivery and 27% were  using modern contraceptive methods. Low socio-economic position was the most  important predictor of underutilization with a clear gradient across SEP quintiles.  Compared to the poorest, the least poor women were more likely to be registered for  ANC (OR 1.96, 95%CI 0.95-4.15) and more likely to have made ≥ 4 ANC visits (OR 5.86,  95%CI 2.82-12.19). They were more likely to have given birth in a facility (OR 4.87,  95%CI 2.12-11.16), to have visited a hospital within one month of childbirth (OR  3.18, 95%CI 1.62-6.26). In general, government funded health insurance and  conditional cash transfers schemes were underutilized in this community. CONCLUSION:  The poorest segment of the urban poor population utilizes reproductive healthcare  facilities the least. Strategies to improve access and utilization of healthcare  services among the poorest of the poor may be necessary to achieve universal health  coverage.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to develop a mobile phone resuscitation guide (MPRG)  and to evaluate its use during simulated resuscitation of a mannequin. METHODS: An  MPRG was developed using EpiSurveyor. A randomised controlled trial was performed in  school-going children aged 15-16 years. All subjects were taught infant CPR skills  using the American Heart Association Infant CPR Anytime. Two weeks later, the  students were randomised to use of MPRG or not, and their CPR skills were  re-assessed. The assessment was conducted using previously validated checklists.  RESULTS: Twenty-one students participated in this trial. The MPRG group performed  notably better in the areas of calling emergency services (80% vs. 36.4%, P =  0.044), completing sufficient CPR cycles (90% vs. 45.5%, P = 0.047) and following  the correct CPR sequence (60% vs. 9.1%, P = 0.013). No difference in resuscitation  skills of participants was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that participants  were more likely to call emergency services if they were using the MPRG. Further  trials are needed to investigate the utility of mobile phone guides and whether or  not they can reduce the time taken to contact emergency services as well as if they  can sustain correct CPR sequence in an in-vivo setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Feedback is a major component of any educational process. Competency  assessment and feedback are essential tools for teaching surgical skills. Most  current systems of assessment within neurosurgical residency programs use  evaluations aggregated over a period of time, which lead to significant bias, rather  than case-specific feedback. We describe the use of a mobile device application  called SIMPL (System for Improving and Measuring Procedural Learning) to allow for  immediate surgical competency assessment and improve the quality of feedback after  every operative experience. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed our use of this  program and neurosurgery residents' response to the program. Institutional review  board approval was not required, and no patients were involved in the study. This  application has already been implemented within general surgery programs with  promising results. We document its implementation in a neurosurgery program and the  output of the program for residents and program directors. RESULTS: This is the  first documentation of such an application within a neurosurgical residency program.  In a 6-month period at a single institution, around 300 evaluations were completed  by residents and faculty, with a >80% response rate within both groups. Furthermore,  these evaluations were companied by a 60% dictation rate from faculty, which  contains verbal feedback that is available to residents for playback at any time.  CONCLUSIONS: The telephone-based SIMPL application allows for assessment of surgical  competency and remains quick and easy to use, giving it the potential to improve  individual neurosurgical training experiences across the United States.

T2  - JMIR cancer
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need for tools to decrease cancer patients' and survivors'  long-term symptom burden. Complementary strategies, such as meditation, can  accompany pharmacologic therapy to improve symptoms. Although support programs with  targeted content have wider reach, higher adherence, and greater impact, there are  no consumer-based meditation apps designed specifically for cancer. OBJECTIVE: This  study aimed to gather information to advise the development of a cancer-specific  meditation app in a small convenience sample of cancer patients and survivors who  currently use the Calm app. METHODS: Adult cancer patients and survivors who are  Calm users (N=82) were recruited through the Daily Calm Facebook page. Participants  completed a Web-based survey related to Calm app use and satisfaction, interest in  and ideas for a cancer-specific Calm app, and demographic characteristics.  Open-ended responses were inductively coded. RESULTS: Participants were aged between  18 and 72 years (mean 48.60 years, SD 15.20), mostly female (77/82, 94%), white  (65/79, 82%), and non-Hispanic (70/75, 93%), and reported using Calm at least 5  times per week (49/82, 60%). Although rates of satisfaction with current Calm  components were high (65/82, 79%; and 51/81, 63%), only 49% (40/82) of participants  used guided meditations that they felt specifically helped with their cancer-related  symptoms and survivorship, and 40% (33/82) would prefer more cancer-related content,  with guided meditations for cancer-specific anxieties (eg, fear of recurrence; n=15)  and coping with strong emotions (n=12) being the most common suggestions. A majority  of participants (51/82, 62%) reported that they would be interested in becoming a  member of a Calm cancer community (eg, in-app discussion boards: 41/46, 89%; and  social media communities: 35/42, 83%). Almost half of the participants (37/82, 45%)  reported that they would benefit from features that tracked symptoms in concurrence  with app usage, but respondents were divided on whether this information should be  shared with health care providers through the app (49/82, 60% would share).  CONCLUSIONS: Responses suggest ways in which the current Calm app could be adapted  to better fit cancer patients' and survivors' needs and preferences, including  adding more cancer-specific content, increasing the amount of content focusing on  coping with strong emotions, developing communities for Calm users who are cancer  patients and survivors, and including features that track cancer-related symptoms.  Given differences in opinions about which features were desirable or would be  useful, there is a clear need for future cancer-specific apps to be customizable  (eg, ability to turn different features on or off). Although future research should  address these topics in larger, more diverse samples, these data will serve as a  starting point for the development of cancer-specific meditation app and provide a  framework for evaluating their effects.

AB  - Many countries are shifting their efforts from malaria control to disease  elimination. New technologies will be necessary to meet the more stringent demands  of elimination campaigns, including improved quality control of malaria diagnostic  tests, as well as an improved means for communicating test results among field  healthcare workers, test manufacturers, and national ministries of health. In this  report, we describe and evaluate an embedded barcode within standard rapid  diagnostic tests as one potential solution. This information-augmented diagnostic  test operates on the familiar principles of traditional lateral flow assays and  simply replaces the control line with a control grid patterned in the shape of a QR  (quick response) code. After the test is processed, the QR code appears on both  positive or negative tests. In this report we demonstrate how this multipurpose code  can be used not only to fulfill the control line role of test validation, but also  to embed test manufacturing details, serve as a trigger for image capture, enable  registration for image analysis, and correct for lighting effects. An accompanying  mobile phone application automatically captures an image of the test when the QR  code is recognized, decodes the QR code, performs image processing to determine the  concentration of the malarial biomarker histidine-rich protein 2 at the test line,  and transmits the test results and QR code payload to a secure web portal. This  approach blends automated, sub-nanomolar biomarker detection, with near real-time  reporting to provide quality assurance data that will help to achieve malaria  elimination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To achieve a measles free world, effective communication must be part of  all elimination plans. The choice of communication approaches must be evidence  based, locally appropriate, interactive and community owned. In this article, we  document the innovative approach of using house visits supported by a web-enabled  mobile phone application to create a real-time platform for adaptive management of  supplemental measles immunization days in Kenya. METHODS: One thousand nine hundred  and fifty-two Red Cross volunteers were recruited, trained and deployed to conduct  house-to-house canvassing in 11 urban districts of Kenya. Three days before the  campaigns, volunteers conducted house visits with a uniform approach and package of  messages. All house visits were documented using a web-enabled mobile phone  application (episurveyor®) that in real-time relayed information collected to all  campaign management levels. During the campaigns, volunteers reported daily  immunizations to their co-ordinators. Post-campaign house visits were also conducted  within 4 days, to verify immunization of eligible children, assess information  sources and detect adverse events following immunization. RESULTS: Fifty-six per  cent of the 164 643 households visited said that they had heard about the planned  2012 measles vaccination campaign 1-3 days before start dates. Twenty-five per cent  of households were likely to miss the measles supplemental dose if they had not been  reassured by the house visit. Pre- and post-campaign reasons for refusal showed that  targeted communication reduced misconceptions, fear of injections and trust in  herbal remedies. Daily reporting of immunizations using mobile phones informed  changes in service delivery plans for better immunization coverage. House visits  were more remembered (70%) as sources of information compared with traditional mass  awareness channels like megaphones (41%) and radio (37%). CONCLUSIONS: In  high-density settlements, house-to-house visits are easy and more penetrative  compared with traditional media approaches. Using mobile phones to document campaign  processes and outputs provides real time evidence for service delivery planning to  improve immunization coverage.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Anxiety is a common emotion that people often feel in  certain situations. But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes  with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety  disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic  attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all  aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal  relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care,  which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers  such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution  to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and  promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the  aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of  treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated  mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS  systems. METHOD: A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store  following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis  (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly  rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and  analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. RESULTS: A total of 167  anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the  selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep  issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management  approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive  behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various  gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social  features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46%  offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health  professionals in their design. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety apps incorporate various mental  health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to  assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety  disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - PURPOSE: Real-time symptom monitoring using a mobile phone is potentially  advantageous for patients receiving oral chemotherapy. We therefore conducted a  pilot study of patient dose adaptation using mobile phone monitoring of specific  symptoms to investigate relative dose intensity of capecitabine, level of toxicity  and perceived supportive care. METHODS: Patients with breast or colorectal cancer  receiving capecitabine completed a symptom, temperature and dose diary twice a day  using a mobile phone application. This information was encrypted and automatically  transmitted in real time to a secure server, with moderate levels of toxicity  automatically prompting self-care symptom management messages on the screen of the  patient's mobile phone or in severe cases, a call from a specialist nurse to advise  on care according to an agreed protocol. RESULTS: Patients (n = 26) completed the  mobile phone diary on 92.6 % of occasions. Twelve patients had a maximum toxicity  grade of 3 (46.2 %). The average dose intensity for all patients as a percentage of  standard dose was 90 %. In eight patients, the dose of capecitabine was reduced, and  in eight patients, the dose of capecitabine was increased. Patients and healthcare  professionals involved felt reassured by the novel monitoring system, in particular,  during out of hours. CONCLUSION: It is possible to optimise the individual dose of  oral chemotherapy safely including dose increase and to manage chemotherapy side  effects effectively using real-time mobile phone monitoring of toxicity parameters  entered by the patient.

AB  - Accuracy of the radiotherapy requires some routine quality control and dosimetry  calculations, which would be done by radiotherapy physicists. Due to the increasing  use of computers and simulation software in medical science, as well as trends  indicating its continued growth, this study aims to develop a new smart-phone  application to perform common radiotherapy-related calculations. Computational  formulas related to the parameters of conventional radiotherapy physics were  obtained from radiotherapy physics textbooks, and the proposed application was  developed using Java, based on the Android operating system. The developed  application can be used on smart-phones with Android version 4 and higher, and it  facilitates saving of data and results. By entering specific information, certain  calculations can be made, including those applicable to superficial dosimetry,  cobalt dosimetry (water phantom), cobalt dosimetry (in air), timer error, time dose  fractionation (TDF) Dose, time dose fractionation (TDF) fractionation, superficial  cone, superficial collimator, equivalent square, Linac dose, tissue phantom ratio  20-10, motorized wedge, field gap, biologically effective dose (BED), absolute Linac  dosimetry, Mayneord F factor. The accuracy of the apps results checked with the  present software installed on the PCs. Given that there are no existing applications  in this field, the proposed App could be useful in facilitating and accelerating  radiotherapy related calculations.

AB  - Free-roaming dogs (FRD) represent a potential threat to the quality of life in  cities from an ecological, social and public health point of view. One of the most  urgent concerns is the role of uncontrolled dogs as reservoirs of infectious  diseases transmittable to humans and, above all, rabies. An estimate of the FRD  population size and characteristics in a given area is the first step for any  relevant intervention programme. Direct count methods are still prominent because of  their non-invasive approach, information technologies can support such methods  facilitating data collection and allowing for a more efficient data handling. This  paper presents a new framework for data collection using a topological algorithm  implemented as ArcScript in ESRI® ArcGIS software, which allows for a random  selection of the sampling areas. It also supplies a mobile phone application for  Android® operating system devices which integrates Global Positioning System (GPS)  and Google MapsTM. The potential of such a framework was tested in 2 Italian  regions. Coupling technological and innovative solutions associated with common  counting methods facilitate data collection and transcription. It also paves the way  to future applications, which could support dog population management systems.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of implementing a  multiple-behavior self-monitoring intervention within a diabetes education program.  This study was a 3-month pre- post-design, conducted with African-Americans (N =  20), who attended diabetes education classes at a large Veteran's Affairs (VA)  hospital in Southwest Texas. Participants selfmonitored their blood glucose, diet,  exercise, and weight on either a smart phone application or paper diaries. Paired t  tests showed strong evidence that patient self-monitoring of healthy lifestyle  behaviors improved blood glucose (t = -3.858, p = .001) and HbAlc (t = -4.428, p  <.001), respectively. Moreover Spearman's correlation coefficient showed significant  correlations between blood glucose and exercise (rs = -.68, p = .008) and HbAlc and  exercise (rs = -.56, p = .036). This feasibility study showed that multiple-behavior  self-monitoring was effective in lowering blood glucose and HbA1c levels among  African-American Veterans; however, a randomized controlled trial with a larger  sample is needed to validate these preliminary findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Internet-based interventions are seen as an important potential strategy  to improve accessibility and affordability of high quality treatments in mental  healthcare. A growing number of studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of  internet-based treatment for mood disorders, but scientific evidence for the  application in routine specialised mental healthcare settings is limited. Also,  little is known about the clinical and health-economic benefits of blended  treatment, where online interventions are integrated with face-to-face treatment of  depression in one treatment protocol. The primary aim of this study is to  investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended Cognitive Behavioural  Therapy (bCBT) for depression, as compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in  specialised routine mental healthcare in the Netherlands. This trial is part of the  E-COMPARED project which has a broader perspective, focussing on primary and  specialised care in eight European countries. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a  randomised controlled non-inferiority trial with two parallel conditions: bCBT and  TAU. The blended treatment combines individual face-to-face CBT with CBT delivered  through an Internet-based treatment platform (Moodbuster). This platform includes a  mobile phone application, used for ecological momentary assessments, automated  feedback and motivational messages. Weekly alternating face-to-face (10) and online  (9) sessions will be delivered over a period of 19-20 weeks. TAU is defined as the  routine care that subjects receive when they are diagnosed with depression in  specialised mental healthcare. Adult patients ≥ 18 years old meeting DSM-IV  diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder will be recruited within  participating outpatient specialised mental healthcare clinics in the Netherlands.  Measurements will be taken at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. The  primary outcome will be depressive symptoms, measured with the PHQ-9 and QIDS.  Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life, mastery, treatment  preference, working alliance, system usability, treatment satisfaction and possible  negative side-effects. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted  from a societal perspective and will include both direct and indirect healthcare  costs. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide insight into the health  and economical outcomes of blended treatment for depression and give an indication  of the value of implementing blended treatment in specialised clinical settings.

AB  - PROBLEM: Smartphone applications are an increasingly useful part of patients'  self-management of chronic health conditions. Asthma is a common chronic health  condition for which good self-management by patients is very helpful in maintaining  stability. User-centered design and intelligent systems that learn are steps forward  in building applications that are more effective in providing quality care that is  scalable and tailored to each patient. METHODS: A literature and application store  search to review historic and current asthma smart phone applications. User-centered  design is a methodology that involves all stakeholders of a proposed system from the  beginning of the design phase to the end of installation. One aspect of this  user-centered approach involved conducting focus groups with patients and health  care providers to determine what features they desire for use in applications and  create a model to build smart infrastructure for a learning health care system. A  simple prototype for an asthma smartphone application is designed and built with  basic functionality. OUTCOMES: Only one publication in the literature review of  asthma smartphone applications describes both user-centered design and intelligent  learning systems. The authors have presented a set of user-desired attributes for a  smart health care application and a possible data flow diagram of information for a  learning system. A prototype simple user-centered designed asthma smartphone  application that better assists patients in their care illustrates the value of the  proposed architecture. DISCUSSION: Our user-centered approach helped design and  implement a learning prototype smart phone application to help patients better  manage their asthma and provide information to clinical care providers. While  popular in other industries, user-centered design has had slow adoption in the  health care area. However, the popularity of this approach is increasing and will  hopefully result in mobile application that better meets the needs of both patients  and their care providers.

Using parameters of Electro-cardiograph  (ECG), Electro-dermal Activity (EDA), body motion and breathing rate (BR), a novel  multi-criteria-decision-system (MCDS) is proposed that reduces false alarms and true  negatives. The combination of a chest and hand worn wearable continuously senses  these parameters transmitting the data to a smart phone application via BLE 4.0  where long-short-term-memory (LSTM) based anomaly detection algorithms and logistic  classifiers decide on the occurrence of the seizure in real time. A 96% precision  and 90% recall is achieved through testing on synthetic data.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with neurogenic bladder (NGB) require periodic urodynamics  (UDS) to evaluate bladder function, which in turn helps guide management. At times,  bladder decompensation or hydronephrosis may develop in patients between urodynamic  testing intervals. Increased surveillance has improved outcomes in other chronic  conditions (e.g., diabetes). Two novel devices, the cystomanometer (CM) and  cystoelastometer (CEM), have been developed at the authors' institution to allow for  home bladder pressure monitoring. The handheld CM can be attached to the end of any  catheter and records the opening bladder pressure along with a time stamp. In  addition, the CEM actively evacuates urine via a pump and records the urine volume  evacuated. For safety, the pump slows and stops as it detects increasing resistance.  Data are stored and transmitted wirelessly from both devices to a smartphone. A  novel phone application stores, displays, and transmits data to a secure hospital  server. OBJECTIVE: This aim of this study was to validate the function of the CM and  CEM and their accuracy relative to UDS. STUDY DESIGN: Institutional review board  approval was obtained. All patients with NGB managed with intermittent  catheterization undergoing routine UDS were eligible for study inclusion. At the  completion of UDS, the instillation port of the 6-French dual-lumen UDS catheter was  connected to the CM or CEM. Bladder parameters were simultaneously recorded using  the device and UDS during bladder emptying. Correlative statistics were calculated.  RESULTS: A total of 36 patients (30 children/6 adults; age range from 1.2 to 38  years [median: 7.5 years]) underwent CM testing. Strong pressure correlation with  UDS was identified (R(2) = 0.89). A total of 42 patients (30 children/12 adults; age  range of 2.9-85.2 years [median: 12.2 years]) underwent CEM testing. Again, strong  pressure correlation was found (R(2) = 0.77). Cystoelastometer volume measurements  were highly correlated with measured volumes (Fig. 4, R(2) = 0.98). DISCUSSION: Both  the CM and CEM functioned well and transmitted the data wirelessly to a smartphone.  The data from these devices were strongly correlated with simultaneous data from the  UDS. A limitation is that these devices were used by healthcare providers, and  therefore, use by patients or their parents/caregivers at home has not been  demonstrated. CONCLUSION: The CM and CEM devices provide accurate bladder pressure  and volume measurements. The potential for improved patient monitoring and care is  promising. Reliability testing and the effects of such monitoring on patient  outcomes remain to be determined.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Characterized by sudden onset of severe joint pain,  swelling, redness, and tenderness to touch, gout 'flare ups' have a substantial  impact on quality of life (QoL). This research employed a patient-centered approach  to explore the symptoms and impacts of gout, and assess the content validity of  existing patient-reported outcomes (PROs). METHODS: Qualitative interviews were  conducted with 30 US gout patients (non-tophaceous: n = 20, tophaceous: n = 10) and  five expert rheumatologists. Each interview included both concept elicitation (CE)  questioning to learn about the patient experience and cognitive debriefing to assess  the content validity of three PRO instruments (HAQ-DI, GAQ, and TIQ-20). Nine of the  patients provided further real-time qualitative data through a smart phone  application. All qualitative data were subject to thematic analysis using Atlas.ti.  Two patient advisors and three expert clinicians were engaged as advisors at key  stages throughout the research. RESULTS: Interview and real-time data identified the  same core symptoms and proximal impact concepts. Severe pain (typically in joints of  extremities) was described as the cardinal symptom, often accompanied by swelling,  redness, heat, sensitivity to touch, and stiffness. Domains of QoL impacted included  physical functioning, sleep, daily activities, and work. The PRO instruments were  generally well-understood by patients, but each included items with questionable  relevance to at least some of the sample, dependent on the specific joints affected.  CONCLUSIONS: Gout patients experience severe pain in affected joints, resulting in  substantial limitations in physical functioning. Both the HAQ-DI and the TIQ-20 are  useful for specific research purposes in the gout population, although modifications  are recommended.

AB  - In China, the access to prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV  services is particularly low among migrant population, which remains a challenge in  the fight against HIV/AIDS. The study is aimed to investigate the PMTCT continuum  for migrant women with HIV (MWHIV) and to identify barriers and potential strategies  to improve the service delivery. The study started with a first round of focus group  discussions with 20 healthcare professionals to map out the local PMTCT service  cascade, followed by in-depth interviews with 20 recently delivered MWHIV to explore  their perceived barriers along each step of the cascade, and a final round of focus  groups with healthcare professionals to identify potential strategies to improve the  PMTCT continuum. Lack of knowledge of antenatal care, stigma and discrimination in  healthcare settings, inadequate provider-patient communication were major barriers  hindering the PMTCT service utilization. Potential strategies to enhance the PMTCT  uptake included broaden publicity to the general population and using mobile phone  application for health education. The issues of HIV designated hospital and  integration of postpartum and neonatal care were also discussed. The study allowed  the healthcare professionals to recognize the service gaps along the PMTCT continuum  and identified potential solutions for service improvement.

AU  - Mukherjee, Soma

AB  - A novel luminescent hydrazone ligand was synthesized via 1:1 condensation reaction  of 9-anthracene aldehyde and 2-hydrazinobenzoic acid followed by its  characterization with the help of absorption, emission, FTIR, NMR and mass studies.  It was investigated as a reversible, ratiometric and turn-on luminescent chemosensor  for Cu(2+) in aqueous environment. The receptor shows a prominent color change in  presence of Cu(2+) from yellow to reddish brown in DMSO-H(2)O (2:1) medium. Upon  addition of Cu(2+), a remarkable increment in emission intensity (Φ = 0.091, 11  fold) was observed probably due to intra-ligand charge transfer transition (ILCT).  Interestingly, this sensor is capable to extract Cu(2+) selectively from aqueous  mixture of metal ions using dichloromethane solvent with the increased extraction  efficiency from 85% (L:Cu(2+), 1:1) to 95% (L:Cu(2+), 2:1) in the pH range of  6.5-10.0. The extraction behavior of Cu(2+) was monitored with the help of UV-Vis  spectroscopy and a readily-usable smartphone to capture the RGB data which may be  helpful as a field based analysis tool. In presence of Cu(2+) (1.0 × 10(-5) M), no  significant interference was observed after addition of 5-fold excess of other metal  ions (Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), Fe(2+), Fe(3+), Ni(2+), Hg(2+), Sn(2+), Al(3+),  Cr(3+), Mn(2+)) in DMSO-H(2)O (2:1) medium. Moreover, the ligand was regenerated (>  98%) by adjusting the pH upto 4 cycles and showed a good recyclability and  reusability which might be helpful to extract Cu(2+) efficiently from aqueous  medium.

AB  - An underwater disaster can be declared when a maritime accident occurred or when an  aircraft is plunged into water area, be it ocean, sea or river. Nevertheless,  handling of human remains in an underwater recovery operation is often a difficult  and demanding task as working conditions may be challenging with poor to no  visibility, location of remains at considerable depths and associated hazards from  surrounding water. A case of the recent helicopter crash, into a famous river in  Sarawak, domiciled by huge crocodiles, is discussed in this paper. Search and  recovery team as well as the combat divers from the Special Elite Troop Commando,  known as VAT 69, were deployed to the scene to perform the underwater recovery to  search for all the victims on board involving five Malaysians with a pilot of  Philippines nationality. This paper highlights the limitations and challenges faced  during the underwater search and recovery. All the bodies recovered were in moderate  decomposition stage with crushed injuries and mutilated face and body. A simple and  conventional fingerprint technique were used to record the fingerprint. The prints  impressions were later photographed using a smartphone and transferred back to the  RMP headquarters in Kuala Lumpur for fingerprint match by using WhatsApp Messenger,  a phone application. All the first five victims were identified within an average of  10min. The last victim recovered was the pilot. For foreign nationals, the  Immigration Department of Malaysia will record the prints of both index fingers  only. The lifting of the fingerprint of the last victim was the most challenging in  which only one index finger left that can be used for comparison. A few techniques  were attempted using the black printer's ink, glass and tape techniques for the last  victim. Subsequently, images of the prints impression were taken using the same  smartphone with additional macro lens attached to it to enhance the resolution. The  images were transferred to the RMP headquarters through WhatsApp Messenger. The  prints were confirmed to be the pilot 20min later.

AB  - Despite ample medical evidence of the adverse impacts of traffic noise on health,  most policies for traffic noise management are arbitrary or incomplete, resulting in  serious social and economic impacts. Surprisingly, there is limited information  about citizen's exposure to traffic noise worldwide. This paper presents the 2Loud?  mobile phone application, developed and tested as a methodology to monitor, assess  and map the level of exposure to traffic noise of citizens with focus on the night  period and indoor locations, since sleep disturbance is one of the major triggers  for ill health related to traffic noise. Based on a community participation  experiment using the 2Loud? mobile phone application in a region close to freeways  in Australia, the results of this research indicates a good level of accuracy for  the noise monitoring by mobile phones and also demonstrates significant levels of  indoor night exposure to traffic noise in the study area. The proposed methodology,  through the data produced and the participatory process involved, can potentially  assist in planning and management towards healthier urban environments.

T2  - Resuscitation
AB  - BACKGROUND: When performed effectively, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by  bystanders reduces mortality due to sudden cardiac arrest. Telemedicine applications  offer a means by which bystanders can get specific instructions for handling the  emergency situation. M-AID, a first aid application for mobile phones, uses an  intelligent algorithm of 'yes' or 'no' questions to judge the ongoing situation and  give the user detailed instructions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the  benefit of this mobile phone application in a scenario of sudden cardiac arrest.  METHODS: One hundred and nineteen volunteers were assigned at random either to the  test or the control group. All participants were confronted with the same scenario  of acute coronary syndrome leading to cardiac arrest. The participants were either  equipped with a mobile phone running the software (test group) or had to handle the  situation without support (control group). The participants received a certain  amount of credits for each action taken according to a pre-defined protocol and  these credits were added to a score and compared between the groups. Participants  were divided into subgroups according to their medical and technical experience.  RESULTS: The test group generally achieved a slightly higher average score that was  not statistically significant (21.11 versus 19.97; p=0.302). In contrast, the  performance of the individuals in the control group was significantly faster (2.41  min versus 4.24 min; p<0.001). Use of the mobile phone software did not enhance the  chance of survival. Subgroup analysis showed that experienced mobile phone users  performed significantly better than non-experienced individuals, but not as well as  participants with advanced first aid knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Experience in the use  of mobile phones is a prerequisite for the efficient use of the tested M-AID  version. This application cannot replace skills acquisition by practical training.  In a subgroup with experience in mobile phone use and basic knowledge in CPR, the  device improved performance of CPR.

An improved ladder positioning method or  procedure could reduce the risk of ladder stability failure and the related fall  injury. The objective of the study was to comparatively evaluate the effectiveness  of a multimodal angle indicator with other existing methods for extension ladder  angular positioning. Twenty experienced and 20 inexperienced ladder users  participated in the study. Four ladder positioning methods were tested in a  controlled laboratory environment with 4.88 m (16 ft) and 7.32 m (24 ft) ladders in  extended and retracted positions. The positioning methods included a no-instruction  method, the current standard anthropometric method, and two instrumental methods - a  bubble level indicator, and a multimodal indicator providing direct feedback with  visual and sound signals. Performance measures included positioning angle and time.  The results indicated that the anthropometric method was effective in improving the  extension ladder positioning angle (p < 0.001); however, it was associated with  considerable variability and required 50% more time than no-instruction. The bubble  level indicator was an accurate positioning method (with very low variability), but  required more than double the time of the no-instruction method (p < 0.001). The  multimodal indicator improved the ladder angle setting as compared to the  no-instruction and anthropometry methods (p < 0.001) and required the least time for  ladder positioning among the tested methods (p < 0.001). An indicator with direct  multimodal feedback is a viable approach for quick and accurate ladder positioning.  The main advantage of the new multimodal method is that it provides continuous  feedback on the angle of the device and hence does not require repositioning of the  ladder. Furthermore, this indicator can be a valuable tool for training ladder users  to correctly apply the current ANSI A14 standard anthropometric method in ladder  angular positioning. The multimodal indicator concept has been further developed to  become a hand-held tool in the form of a smart phone application.

AB  - The recommended method for measuring respiratory rate (RR) is counting breaths for  60 s using a timer. This method is not efficient in a busy clinical setting. There  is an urgent need for a robust, low-cost method that can help front-line health care  workers to measure RR quickly and accurately. Our aim was to develop a more  efficient RR assessment method. RR was estimated by measuring the median time  interval between breaths obtained from tapping on the touch screen of a mobile  device. The estimation was continuously validated by measuring consistency (%  deviation from the median) of each interval. Data from 30 subjects estimating RR  from 10 standard videos with a mobile phone application were collected. A  sensitivity analysis and an optimization experiment were performed to verify that a  RR could be obtained in less than 60 s; that the accuracy improves when more taps  are included into the calculation; and that accuracy improves when inconsistent taps  are excluded. The sensitivity analysis showed that excluding inconsistent tapping  and increasing the number of tap intervals improved the RR estimation. Efficiency  (time to complete measurement) was significantly improved compared to traditional  methods that require counting for 60 s. There was a trade-off between accuracy and  efficiency. The most balanced optimization result provided a mean efficiency of 9.9  s and a normalized root mean square error of 5.6%, corresponding to 2.2 breaths/min  at a respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min. The obtained 6-fold increase in mean  efficiency combined with a clinically acceptable error makes this approach a viable  solution for further clinical testing. The sensitivity analysis illustrating the  trade-off between accuracy and efficiency will be a useful tool to define a target  product profile for any novel RR estimation device.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Innovative Mobile-phone Technology for Community Health Operation  (ImTeCHO) is a mobile-phone application that helps Accredited Social Health  Activists (ASHAs) in complete registration through the strategies employed during  implementation that is linking ASHAs' incentives to digital records, regular  feedback, onsite data entry, and demand generation among beneficiaries. OBJECTIVE:  To determine the proportion of pregnancies, deliveries, and infant deaths (events)  being registered through the ImTeCHO application against actual number of events in  a random sample of villages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five representative villages  were randomly selected from the ImTeCHO project area in the tribal areas of Gujarat,  India to obtain the required sample of 98 recently delivered women. A household  survey was done in the entire villages to enumerate each family and create a  line-listing of events since January 2014; the line-listing was compared with list  of women registered through the ImTeCHO application. The proportion of events being  registered through the ImTeCHO application was compared against the actual number of  events to find sensitivity of the ImTeCHO application. RESULT: A total of 844  families were found during household enumeration. Out of actual line-listing of  pregnancies (N = 39), deliveries (N = 102), and infant deaths (N = 5) found during  household enumeration, 38 (97.43%), 101 (99.01%), and 5 (100%) were registered by  ASHAs through the ImTeCHO application. CONCLUSION: The use of mobile-phone  technology and strategies applied during the ImTeCHO implementation should be  upscaled to supplement efforts to improve the completeness of registration.

TI  - First evaluation steps of a new method for dietary intake estimation regarding a  list of key food groups in adults and in different sociodemographic and  health-related behaviour strata.
AU  - Béjar, Luis M.
T2  - Public health nutrition
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A new method known as 'current-day dietary recall' (current-day recall)  is based on an application for mobile phones called 'electronic 12 h dietary recall'  (e-12HR). This new method was designed to rank participants into categories of  habitual intake regarding a series of key food groups. The present study compared  current-day recall against a previously validated short paper FFQ. DESIGN:  Participants recorded the consumption of selected food groups using e-12HR during  twenty-eight consecutive days and then filled out a short paper FFQ at the end of  the study period. To evaluate the association and agreement between both methods,  Spearman's correlation coefficients (SCC), cross-classification analysis and  weighted kappa statistics (κ w) were used. SETTING: Andalusia, Spain, Southern  Europe. SUBJECTS: University students and employees over the age of 18 years.  RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven participants completed the study (64·2 %  female, 35·8 % male). For all particpants, for all food group intakes, the mean SCC  was 0·70 (SCC≥0·62 were observed for all strata); the mean percentage of  participants cross-classified into categories of 'exact agreement+adjacent' was 90·1  % (percentages≥87·8 % were observed for all strata); and the mean κ w was 0·55 (κ  w≥0·53 in ten of the twelve strata). CONCLUSIONS: For the whole sample and for all  strata thereof, the current-day recall has good agreement with the previously  validated short paper FFQ for assessing food group intakes, rendering it a useful  method for ranking individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) has become the group with the fastest  growing HIV epidemic in China. Since many Chinese MSM are conducting HIV  self-testing, we aimed to determine the rate of HIV care seeking after self-testing,  examine characteristics of "seekers" compared to "non-seekers," and explore factors  associated with HIV care-seeking behaviour. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design  was used and an online survey was conducted in Beijing, China in 2016, among users  of a popular Chinese gay networking smart phone application. Chi-square test was  used to compare characteristics of those who sought HIV care ("seekers") and those  who did not ("non-seekers"). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression  analyses were conducted to assess factors associated with HIV care seeking. RESULTS:  Among 21,785 screened, 2383 participants (10.9%) were included in the study. A total  of 380 participants (15.9%) reported seeking HIV care after HIV self-testing while  2003 (84.1%) did not. Lack of knowledge of the "window period" (adjusted odds ratio  [AOR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.47-0.97, P = 0.04) was associated  with reduced odds of seeking HIV care, while lower monthly income (AOR = 1.29, 95%  CI = 1.03-1.62, P = 0.03) and obtaining HIV self-testing kits from health facilities  (AOR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.81-3.17, P < 0.001), and non-governmental organizations  (AOR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.79-3.34, P < 0.001) was associated with increased odds of  seeking HIV care. Among those who sought HIV care, a large majority (92.4%) had  non-reactive HIV self-testing results. Only 29 out of 265 with reactive, uncertain,  or unknown results sought HIV care. CONCLUSIONS: We found a very low rate of HIV  care seeking among our sample of urban Chinese MSM. The observation that most with  reactive, uncertain, or unknown results did not seek HIV care is a cause for  concern. These people should be paid more attention and helped to enter the care  cascade. Our findings highlight that interventions aimed at improving linkage to  care after HIV self-testing are urgently needed. However, further study is required  to inform the design and implementation of future interventions aiming to encourage  HIV care-seeking behaviour.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) remain the group most affected by the  HIV epidemic in the United States. At least one-quarter of MSM report engagement in  group sex events (GSEs), which can pose a risk for HIV transmission and acquisition.  In this study, identification of event-level correlates of sexual and drug use  behaviours at GSEs was sought to better inform prevention activities. METHODS: For  this study, participants were recruited via banner and pop-up advertisements placed  on a geosocial networking mobile phone application that MSM use to meet men.  RESULTS: Of the 1997 individuals who completed the study screener, 36.0% reported  participating in at least one GSE in the prior year. In multivariable logistic  regression analysis, attendance at a GSE in the past year was significantly  associated with older age, full/part time employment and being HIV positive. Of the  men who attended a GSE, more than half reported condomless anal sex (CAS) with at  least one of their partners (insertive: 57.7%; receptive: 56.3%). MSM who indicated  drug use had significantly higher odds of having insertive CAS [odds ratio  (OR)=2.45; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.37-4.39] and receptive CAS (OR=3.60; 95%  CI: 1.96-6.63) at their last GSE. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of HIV-positive  MSM engaging in group sex, coupled with their greater odds of CAS, poses a  significant risk for HIV/STI transmission within the group sex setting. More  research is needed to determine patterns of condom use at these events and whether  seroadaptive behaviours are driving CAS.

AB  - Cities in the United States have announced initiatives to become more sustainable,  healthy, resilient, livable, and environmentally friendly. However, indicators for  measuring all outcomes related to these targets and the synergies between them have  not been well defined or studied. One such relationship is the linkage between air  quality with emotional well-being (EWB) and neighborhood infrastructure. Here,  regulatory monitoring, low-cost sensors (LCSs), and air quality modeling were  combined to assess exposures to PM(2.5) and traffic-related NO(x) in 6 Minneapolis,  MN, neighborhoods of varying infrastructure parameters (median household income,  urban vs suburban, and access to light rail). Residents of the study neighborhoods  concurrently took real-time EWB assessments using a smart phone application,  Daynamica, to gauge happiness, tiredness, stress, sadness, and pain. Both LCS  PM(2.5) observations and mobile-source-simulated NO(x) were calibrated using  regulatory observations in Minneapolis. No statistically significant (α = 0.05)  PM(2.5) differences were found between urban poor and urban middle-income  neighborhoods, but average mobile-source NO(x) was statistically significantly  (α = 0.05) higher in the 4 urban neighborhoods than in the 2 suburban neighborhoods.  Close proximity to light rail had no observable impact on average observed PM(2.5)  or simulated mobile-source NO(x). Home-based exposure assessments found that PM(2.5)  was negatively correlated with positive emotions such as happiness and to net affect  (the sum of positive and negative emotion scores) and positively correlated (ie, a  higher PM(2.5) concentration led to higher scores) for negative emotions such as  tiredness, stress, sadness, and pain. Simulated mobile-source NO(x), assessed from  both home-based exposures and in situ exposures, had a near-zero relationship with  all EWB indicators. This was attributed to low NO(x) levels throughout the study  neighborhoods and at locations were the EWB-assessed activities took place, both  owing to low on-road mobile-source NO(x) impacts. Although none of the air quality  and EWB responses were determined to be statistically significant (α = 0.05), due in  part to the relatively small sample size, the results are suggestive of linkages  between air quality and a variety of EWB outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Household air pollution (HAP) from combustion of solid fuels is an  important contributor to disease burden in low- and middle-income countries (LIC,  and MIC). However, current HAP disease burden estimates are based on integrated  exposure response curves that are not currently informed by quantitative HAP studies  in LIC and MIC. While there is adequate evidence supporting causal relationships  between HAP and respiratory disease, large cohort studies specifically examining  relationships between quantitative measures of HAP exposure with cardiovascular  disease are lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aim to improve upon exposure proxies based on  fuel type, and to reduce exposure misclassification by quantitatively measuring  exposure across varying cooking fuel types and conditions in diverse geographies and  socioeconomic settings. We leverage technology advancements to estimate household  and personal PM(2.5) (particles below 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter) exposure  within the large (N~250,000) multi-country (N~26) Prospective Urban and Rural  Epidemiological (PURE) cohort study. Here, we detail the study protocol and the  innovative methodologies being used to characterize HAP exposures, and their  application in epidemiologic analyses. METHODS/DESIGN: This study characterizes HAP  PM(2.5) exposures for participants in rural communities in ten PURE countries with  >10% solid fuel use at baseline (Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, India,  Pakistan, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe). PM(2.5) monitoring includes 48-h  cooking area measurements in 4500 households and simultaneous personal monitoring of  male and female pairs from 20% of the selected households. Repeat measurements occur  in 20% of households to assess impacts of seasonality. Monitoring began in 2017, and  will continue through 2019. The Ultrasonic Personal Aerosol Sampler (UPAS), a novel,  robust, and inexpensive filter based monitor that is programmable through a  dedicated mobile phone application is used for sampling. Pilot study field  evaluation of cooking area measurements indicated high correlation between the UPAS  and reference Harvard Impactors (r = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.95; slope = 0.95). To  facilitate tracking and to minimize contamination and analytical error, the samplers  utilize barcoded filters and filter cartridges that are weighed pre- and  post-sampling using a fully automated weighing system. Pump flow and pressure  measurements, temperature and RH, GPS coordinates and semi-quantitative continuous  particle mass concentrations based on filter differential pressure are uploaded to a  central server automatically whenever the mobile phone is connected to the internet,  with sampled data automatically screened for quality control parameters. A short  survey is administered during the 48-h monitoring period. Post-weighed filters are  further analyzed to estimate black carbon concentrations through a semi-automated,  rapid, cost-effective image analysis approach. The measured PM(2.5) data will then  be combined with PURE survey information on household characteristics and behaviours  collected at baseline and during follow-up to develop quantitative HAP models for  PM(2.5) exposures for all rural PURE participants (~50,000) and across different  cooking fuel types within the 10 index countries. Both the measured (in the subset)  and the modelled exposures will be used in separate longitudinal epidemiologic  analyses to assess associations with cardiopulmonary mortality, and disease  incidence. DISCUSSION: The collected data and resulting characterization of cooking  area and personal PM(2.5) exposures in multiple rural communities from 10 countries  will better inform exposure assessment as well as future epidemiologic analyses  assessing the relationships between quantitative estimates of chronic HAP exposure  with adult mortality and incident cardiovascular and respiratory disease. This will  provide refined and more accurate exposure estimates in global CVD related  exposure-response analyses.

AB  - Changing climatic conditions on seasonal and longer time scales influence  agricultural production. Improvement of soil and fertilizer is a strong factor in  agricultural production, but agricultural production is influenced by climate  conditions even in highly developed countries. It is valuable if fewer predictors  make it possible to conduct future projections. Monthly temperature and  precipitation, wintertime 500hPa geopotential height, and the previous year's yield  are used as predictors to forecast spring wheat yield in advance. Canadian small  agricultural divisions (SAD) are used for analysis. Each SAD is composed of a  collection of Canadian Agricultural Regions (CAR) of similar weather and growing  conditions. Spring wheat yields in each CAR are forecast from the following  variables: (a) the previous year's yield, (b) earlier stages of the growing season's  climate conditions and, (c) the previous year's wintertime northern hemisphere  500hPa geopotential height field. Arctic outflow events in the Okanagan Valley in  Canada are associated with episodes of extremely low temperatures during wintertime.  Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied for wintertime northern hemisphere  500hPa geopotential height anomalies. The spatial PCA mode1 is defined as Arctic  Oscillation and it influences prevailing westerlies. The prevailing westerlies  meanders and influences climatic conditions. The spatial similarity between  wintertime top 5 Arctic outflow event year's composites of 500hPa geopotential  height anomalies and mode 3's spatial pattern is found. Mode 3's spatial pattern  looks like the Pacific/North American (PNA) pattern which describes the variation of  atmospheric circulation pattern over the Pacific Ocean and North America. Climate  conditions from April to June, May to July, mode 3's time coefficients, and previous  year's yield are used for forecasting spring wheat yield in each SAD.  Cross-validation procedure which generates eight sets of models for the eight  validation periods is used. To show the reproducing projection between observed and  calculated values, the root mean squared error for skill score (RMSE SS) with the  persistence model serving as the reference model is used. The persistence model is  used as a benchmark. The results show that SADs near USA border show better RMSE SS  values and mode 3's time coefficients can be a useful predictor especially for  inland province such as Manitoba. Among 27 Canadian Prairie's SADs with perfect  yield data, 67% of Alberta's SADs, 86% of Manitoba's SADs, and 77% of Saskatchewan's  SADs can get positive skill scores. In each SAD, future yield projection is  calculated applying predictors in 2013 for the obtained eight sets of models and  eight sets of forecasted values in 2013 are averaged and a near future projection  result is obtained. Series of outputs including calculated forecasted yield value in  each SAD is provided by smart phone application. A system for providing climatic  condition for a point with a permission of Climatic Research Unit - University of  East Anglia and for obtaining patent is proposed. There are several patented systems  similar to the system proposed in this paper. However, these patents are different  in essence. The system proposed in this paper consists of two parts. First part is  to estimate equations using time series data. The second part is to acquire and  apply latest climatic conditions for obtained equations and calculate future  projection. If the procedure is refined and devices are originally developed, series  of idea can be patented. For future work, crop index, Hokkaido is also introduced.

AB  - Field studies on arthropod ecology and behaviour require simple and robust  monitoring tools, preferably with direct access to an integrated database. We have  developed and here present a database tool allowing smart-phone based monitoring of  arthropods. This smart phone application provides an easy solution to collect,  manage and process the data in the field which has been a very difficult task for  field biologists using traditional methods. To monitor our example species, the  desert ant Cataglyphis fortis, we considered behavior, nest search runs, feeding  habits and path segmentations including detailed information on solar position and  azimuth calculation, ant orientation and time of day. For this we established a user  friendly database system integrating the Ant-App-DB with a smart phone and tablet  application, combining experimental data manipulation with data management and  providing solar position and timing estimations without any GPS or GIS system.  Moreover, the new desktop application Dataplus allows efficient data extraction and  conversion from smart phone application to personal computers, for further  ecological data analysis and sharing. All features, software code and database as  well as Dataplus application are made available completely free of charge and  sufficiently generic to be easily adapted to other field monitoring studies on  arthropods or other migratory organisms. The software applications Ant-App-DB and  Dataplus described here are developed using the Android SDK, Java, XML, C# and  SQLite Database.

AB  - Four proximal soil sensors were tested at four smallholder farms in Embu County,  Kenya: a portable X-ray fluorescence sensor (PXRF), a mobile phone application for  soil color determination by photography, a dual-depth electromagnetic induction  (EMI) sensor, and a LED-based soil optical reflectance sensor. Measurements were  made at 32-43 locations at each site. Topsoil samples were analyzed for  plant-available nutrients (N, P, K, Mg, Ca, S, B, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Fe), pH, total  nitrogen (TN) and total carbon (TC), soil texture, cation exchange capacity (CEC),  and exchangeable aluminum (Al). Multivariate prediction models of each of the  lab-analyzed soil properties were parameterized for 576 sensor-variable  combinations. Prediction models for K, N, Ca and S, B, Zn, Mn, Fe, TC, Al, and CEC  met the setup criteria for functional, robust, and accurate models. The PXRF sensor  was the sensor most often included in successful models. We concluded that the  combination of a PXRF and a portable soil reflectance sensor is a promising  combination of handheld soil sensors for the development of in situ soil assessments  as a field-based alternative or complement to laboratory measurements.

AB  - Trauma exposure markedly increases risk for psychopathology including posttraumatic  stress disorder (PTSD). Understanding the course by which PTSD develops after a  traumatic event is critical to enhancing early intervention. Although prior work has  explored the course of PTSD symptoms in the subsequent months, relatively few  studies have explored the course of symptoms in the acute post-trauma period,  defined as the 30 days after a traumatic event. A key challenge to conducting such  studies is the lack of efficient means to collect data that does not impose  significant burden on the participant during this time. The present study evaluated  the use of a mobile phone application to collect symptom data during the acute post  trauma period. Data was obtained from 23 individuals who experienced a Criterion A  traumatic event and were recruited from the Emergency Department of a Level 1 Trauma  Center. Participants completed 44.93% of daily assessments across a 30-day period.  Responses rates were uncorrelated with PTSD symptoms or depression symptoms at  1-month and 3-month posttrauma. Participants reported that the surveys were  moderately helpful and posed minimal burden. These findings suggest that mobile  applications can be used to learn about the course of post-trauma recovery.

AB  - We are entering the era of personalized medicine in which an individual's genetic  makeup will eventually determine how a doctor can tailor his or her therapy.  Therefore, it is becoming critical to understand the genetic basis of common  diseases, for example, which genes predispose and rare genetic variants contribute  to diseases, and so on. Our study focuses on helping researchers, medical  practitioners, and pharmacists in having a broad view of genetic variants that may  be implicated in the likelihood of developing certain diseases. Our focus here is to  create a comprehensive database with mobile access to all available, authentic and  actionable genes, SNPs, and classified diseases and drugs collected from different  clinical and genomics databases worldwide, including Ensembl, GenCode, ClinVar,  GeneCards, DISEASES, HGMD, OMIM, GTR, CNVD, Novoseek, Swiss-Prot, LncRNADisease,  Orphanet, GWAS Catalog, SwissVar, COSMIC, WHO, and FDA. We present a new  cutting-edge gene-SNP-disease-drug mobile database with a smart phone application,  integrating information about classified diseases and related genes, germline and  somatic mutations, and drugs. Its database includes over 59 000 protein-coding and  noncoding genes; over 67 000 germline SNPs and over a million somatic mutations  reported for over 19 000 protein-coding genes located in over 1000 regions,  published with over 3000 articles in over 415 journals available at the PUBMED; over  80 000 ICDs; over 123 000 NDCs; and over 100 000 classified gene-SNP-disease  associations. We present an application that can provide new insights into the  information about genetic basis of human complex diseases and contribute to  assimilating genomic with phenotypic data for the availability of gene-based  designer drugs, precise targeting of molecular fingerprints for tumor, appropriate  drug therapy, predicting individual susceptibility to disease, diagnosis, and  treatment of rare illnesses are all a few of the many transformations expected in  the decade to come.

AB  - With the emergence of mobile health (mHealth) apps, there is a growing demand for  better tools for developing and evaluating mobile health interventions. Recently we  developed the Personal Health Intervention Toolkit (PHIT), a software framework  which eases app implementation and facilitates scientific evaluation. PHIT  integrates self-report and physiological sensor instruments, evidence-based advisor  logic, and self-help interventions such as meditation, health education, and  cognitive behavior change. PHIT can be used to facilitate research, interventions  for chronic diseases, risky behaviors, sleep, medication adherence, environmental  monitoring, momentary data collection health screening, and clinical decision  support. In a series of usability evaluations, participants reported an overall  usability score of 4.5 on a 1-5 Likert scale and an 85 score on the System Usability  Scale, indicating a high percentile rank of 95%.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity is associated with reduced risks of many chronic  diseases. Data collected on physical activity in large epidemiological studies is  often based on paper questionnaires. The validity of these questionnaires is  debated, and more effective methods are needed. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates  repeated measures of physical activity level (PAL) and the feasibility of using a  Java-based questionnaire downloaded onto cell phones for collection of such data.  The data obtained were compared with reference estimates based on the doubly labeled  water method and indirect calorimetry (PAL(ref)). METHOD: Using a Java-based cell  phone application, 22 women reported their physical activity based on two short  questions answered daily over a 14-day period (PAL(cell)). Results were compared  with reference data obtained from the doubly labeled water method and indirect  calorimetry (PAL(ref)). Results were also compared against physical activity levels  assessed by two regular paper questionnaires completed by women at the end of the  14-day period (PAL(quest1) and PAL(quest2)). PAL(cell), PAL(quest1), and PAL(quest2)  were compared with PAL(ref) using the Bland and Altman procedure. RESULTS: The mean  difference between PAL(cell) and PAL(ref) was small (0.014) with narrow limits of  agreement (2SD = 0.30). Compared with PAL(ref), the mean difference was also small  for PAL(quest1) and PAL(quest2) (0.004 and 0.07, respectively); however, the limits  of agreement were wider (PAL(quest1), 2SD = 0.50 and PAL(quest2), 2SD = 0.90). The  test for trend was statistically significant for PAL(quest1) (slope of regression  line = 0.79, P = .04) as well as for PAL(quest2) (slope of regression line = 1.58, P  < .001) when compared with PAL(ref). CONCLUSION: A Java-based physical activity  questionnaire administered daily using cell phones produced PAL estimates that  agreed well with PAL reference values. Furthermore, the limits of agreement between  PAL obtained using cell phones, and reference values were narrower than for  corresponding estimates obtained using paper questionnaires. Java-based  questionnaires downloaded onto cell phones may be a feasible and cost-effective  method of data collection for large-scale prospective studies of physical activity.

This amplifier interfaces a sensing probe  and connects wirelessly with a computer or smartphone for the required stimulus  input, data processing and storage. To test the proposed Signal Transduction by Ion  Nanogating (STING) wireless amplifier, in the current study the system was tested  with a nano-pH sensor to measure pH of standard buffer solutions and the performance  was compared against the commercial voltage-clamp amplifier. To our best knowledge,  STING amplifier is the first miniaturized wireless voltage-clamp platform operated  with a customized smart-phone application (app).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persons with a past episode of self-harm or severe suicidal ideation are  at elevated risk of self-harm as well as dying by suicide. It is well established  that suicidal ideation fluctuates over time. Previous studies have shown that a  personal safety plan can assist in providing support, when a person experiences  suicide ideation, and help seeking professional assistance if needed. The aim of the  trial is to determine whether a newly developed safety mobile app is more effective  in reducing suicide ideation and other symptoms, compared to a safety plan on paper.  METHODS/DESIGN: The trial is designed as a two-arm, observer-blinded, parallel-group  randomized clinical superiority trial, where participants will either receive: (1)  Experimental intervention: the safety plan provided as the app MyPlan, or (2)  Treatment as Usual: the safety plan in the original paper format. Based on a power  calculation, a total of 546 participants, 273 in each arm will be included. They  will be recruited from Danish Suicide Prevention Clinics. Both groups will receive  standard psychosocial therapeutic care, up to 8-10 sessions of supportive  psychotherapy. Primary outcome will be reduction in suicide ideation after  12 months. Follow-up interviews will be conducted at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after  date of inclusion. DISCUSSION: A safety plan is a mandatory part of the treatment in  the Suicide Prevention Clinics in Demark. There are no studies investigating the  effectiveness of a safety plan app compared to a safety plan on paper on reducing  suicide ideation in patients with suicide ideation and suicidal behavior. The trial  will gain new knowledge of whether modern technology can augment the effects of  traditional personalized safety planning. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov,  NCT02877316 .

AB  - We have developed GaitTrack, a phone application to detect health status while the  smartphone is carried normally. GaitTrack software monitors walking patterns, using  only accelerometers embedded in phones to record spatiotemporal motion, without the  need for sensors external to the phone. Our software transforms smartphones into  health monitors, using eight parameters of phone motion transformed into body motion  by the gait model. GaitTrack is designed to detect health status while the  smartphone is carried during normal activities, namely, free-living walking. The  current method for assessing free-living walking is medical accelerometers, so we  present evidence that mobile phones running our software are more accurate. We then  show our gait model is more accurate than medical pedometers for counting steps of  patients with chronic disease. Our gait model was evaluated in a pilot study  involving 30 patients with chronic lung disease. The six-minute walk test (6 MWT) is  a major assessment for chronic heart and lung disease, including congestive heart  failure and especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), affecting  millions of persons. The 6 MWT consists of walking back and forth along a measured  distance for 6 minutes. The gait model using linear regression performed with 94.13%  accuracy in measuring walk distance, compared with the established standard of  direct observation. We also evaluated a different statistical model using the same  gait parameters to predict health status through lung function. This gait model has  high accuracy when applied to demographic cohorts, for example, 89.22% accuracy  testing the cohort of 12 female patients with ages 50-64 years.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal addresses a growing  multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemic by shifting care and treatment  from trained specialty centers to community hospitals, delivering and monitoring  MDR-TB therapy has presented new challenges. In particular, tracking and reporting  adverse clinical events have been difficult for mobile healthcare workers (HCWs),  trained health professionals who travel daily to patient homes to administer and  monitor therapy. We designed and piloted a mobile phone application (Mobilize) for  mobile HCWs that electronically standardized the recording and tracking of MDR-TB  patients on low-cost, functional phones. OBJECTIVE: We assess the acceptability and  feasibility of using Mobilize to record and submit adverse events forms weekly  during the intensive phase of MDR-TB therapy and evaluate mobile HCW perceptions  throughout the pilot period. METHODS: All five mobile HCWs at one site were trained  and provided with phones. Utilizing a mixed-methods evaluation, mobile HCWs' usage  patterns were tracked electronically for seven months and analyzed. Qualitative  focus groups and questionnaires were designed to understand the impact of mobile  phone technology on the work environment. RESULTS: Mobile HCWs submitted nine of 33  (27%) expected adverse events forms, conflicting with qualitative results in which  mobile HCWs stated that Mobilize improved adverse events communication, helped their  daily workflow, and could be successfully expanded to other health interventions.  When presented with the conflict between their expressed views and actual practice,  mobile HCWs cited forgetfulness and believed patients should take more  responsibility for their own care. DISCUSSION: This pilot experience demonstrated  poor uptake by HCWs despite positive responses to using mHealth. Though our results  should be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of mobile HCWs and  MDR-TB patients in this study, we recommend carefully exploring the motivations of  HCWs and technologic enhancements prior to scaling new mHealth initiatives in  resource poor settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the acceptability and effectiveness of a  relationship-focussed mobile phone application (WeClick) for improving depressive  symptoms and other mental health outcomes in adolescents. METHODS: A randomised  controlled trial involving 193 youth (M age: 14.82, SD: 0.94, 86.5% female) from  Australia was conducted. Youth were recruited via the Internet and randomly  allocated to the intervention or a 4-week wait list control condition, stratified  for age and gender. The primary outcome was change in depressive symptom scores  measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A) at baseline,  4-week post-test and 12-week follow-up. Secondary outcomes included anxiety,  psychological distress, wellbeing, help-seeking intentions for mental health, social  self-efficacy and social support. Participants in the intervention condition  received access to the intervention for four weeks. Thematic analysis was utilised  to identify and examine acceptability. RESULTS: The change in PHQ-A scores from  baseline to 4-week post-test did not differ significantly (d = 0.26, p = .138)  between the intervention (Mchange = -2.9, SD = 5.3) and wait list control conditions  (Mchange = -1.7, SD = 4.3). However, significant between-group improvements were  observed in wellbeing (d = 0.37, p = .023), help-seeking intentions (d = 0.36,  p = .016) and professional help-seeking intentions for mental health problems  (d = 0.36, p = .008). Increases in help-seeking intentions were sustained at  follow-up in the intervention condition. No differential effects were found for  generalised anxiety, separation anxiety, social self-efficacy or for any social  support outcomes. Over 90% of participants indicated the app was enjoyable,  interesting and easy to use. The app provided 'advice and direction' (n = 42;  46.15%), an 'opportunity for self-reflection' (n = 33; 36.3%) and 'normalised  experiences' (n = 21; 23.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The WeClick app was found to be effective  for improving wellbeing and help-seeking intentions for mental health in  adolescents. A larger, adequately powered trial is now required to establish  differential effects on depressive symptoms. This trial was registered with the  Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): ACTRN12618001982202.

AB  - PURPOSE: As part of a larger study to test the efficacy of the Concussion Coach cell  phone application for patients with post-concussion symptoms, qualitative data were  gathered to assess barriers and facilitators for app use and differences in use of  the app among those who declined or improved in symptom severity, or were low-use  users. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a prospective descriptive study design, 35  semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted between 2016-2018.  Participants had a history of mild traumatic brain injury and were symptomatic.  Interview data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Primary  facilitators were the app's ease of use, privacy, availability/portability, and  increased self-efficacy of the user. Primary barriers were a lack of sufficient app  training, stigma, overly "basic" content, and symptom severity. While there were not  prominent differences among user groups, users whose symptom severity improved  described using more modules of the app than users who declined. Low-users  attributed not using the app to content that was too basic or to their forgetting.  CONCLUSION: Interview data suggest that Concussion Coach can benefit Veterans with  post-concussive symptoms through increased agency, perceived benefits to emotional  well-being, and the availability of non-stigmatized strategies for symptom  management.

AB  - Cancer patients often need to manage care-related information when they are away  from home, when they are experiencing pain or treatment side effects, or when their  abilities to deal with information effectively are otherwise impaired. In this  paper, we describe the results from a four-week evaluation of HealthWeaver Mobile, a  mobile phone application that we developed to support such "unanchored" patient  information activities. Based on experiences from nine cancer patients, our results  indicate that HealthWeaver Mobile can help patients to access care-related  information from anywhere, to capture information whenever a need arises, and to  share information with clinicians during clinic visits. The enhanced ability to  manage information, in turn, helps patients to manage their care and to feel more  confident in their ability to stay in control of their information and their health.

The questionnaire consisted  of five sections: (1) anthropometric, demographic and clinical characteristics, (2)  knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19, (3) IBD management, (4) prevention  measures, (5) anxiety level during pandemic. Results: One hundred forty two  questionnaires were completed. Ninety-seven patients (68.3%) were males with a mean  age of 46 years (SD 13; range 17-76). Fifty-four individuals (38%) were affected by  Crohn disease and 88 (62%) by Ulcerative Colitis. Most patients reported high  knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19 (80%), IBD management (72%), and  prevention measures (97%). Sixty-two percent of them showed moderate-high level of  anxiety. High education level was independently associated with high knowledge about  clinical importance of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 5, 95% confidence interval [CI]  1.49-16.6, p = 0.009) and older age (OR 1, 95%, CI 1.01-1.1, p = 0.01), while the  receipt of e-format educational material with low knowledge about clinical  importance of COVID-19 (OR 3, 95%, CI 1.08-9.3, p = 0.03). Displaying an active  disease appeared to be independently associated with low knowledge of IBD management  (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.4-22.8, p = 0.01) and no variables other than an older age was  independently associated with higher level of anxiety (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.009-1.09, p  = 0.01). Conclusions: High educational level and aging promote knowledge about  clinical importance of COVID-19, while e-format educational material does not. Taken  together with findings that an active disease status compromises knowledge of IBD  management and the high level of anxiety related to increasing age, these data  suggest the need of further supporting patient-oriented strategies in IBD during  Covid-19 pandemic.

AB  - Precautionary allergen labelling (PAL) has resulted in consumer confusion. Previous  research has shown that interpretive labels (using graphics, symbols, or colours)  are better understood than the traditional forms of labels. In this study, we aimed  to understand if consumers would use interpretive labels (symbol, mobile phone  application and a toll-free number) with or without medical advice that was  advocated by the food industry rather than the normal PAL. This is relevant  information for industry and clinicians as it provides an insight into the food  allergic perception regarding PAL.

AB  - This article is aimed at investigating the use of smart phone software Sina in the  localization of supratentorial lesions, finding the error between Sina method and  neuronavigation, and identifying the reliability of the new method. Neuronavigation  and Sina measurement were used to locate the lesion in the patients whose lesion  lengths are between 2 cm and 6 cm. The reference point was the center of the lesion.  We found the error of Sina method is 13.6 ± 0.55 mm comparing with neuronavigation,  so the Sina method still cannot replace the localization method of the  neuronavigation system. However, in practical clinical work, with the help of the  new method, the lesion can be located more precisely and easily.

AB  - In chronic kidney disease (CKD), referral to nephrology is based on Kidney Disease:  Improving Global Outcomes 2012 guidelines and is generally indicated when the  estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or when there is  a rapid decline of eGFR, elevated urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (>300 mg/g) or  other 'alert' signs such as the presence of urinary red blood cell casts. Since eGFR  declines with ageing in otherwise healthy individuals, we propose that the eGFR  threshold for nephrology referral should be adjusted according to age. According to  current recommendations, young patients without rapidly progressing CKD are referred  more often to nephrology when CKD is more severe, compared with age-matched controls  with normal eGFRs, than elderly CKD patients. In this commentary, we discuss the age  factor and other specific situations not considered in current guidelines for  nephrology referral of CKD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emotional awareness and self-regulation are important skills for  improving mental health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Cognitive  behavioral therapy can teach these skills but is not widely available. OBJECTIVE:  This exploratory study examined the potential of mobile phone technologies to  broaden access to cognitive behavioral therapy techniques and to provide  in-the-moment support. METHODS: We developed a mobile phone application with touch  screen scales for mood reporting and therapeutic exercises for cognitive reappraisal  (ie, examination of maladaptive interpretations) and physical relaxation. The  application was deployed in a one-month field study with eight individuals who had  reported significant stress during an employee health assessment. Participants were  prompted via their mobile phones to report their moods several times a day on a Mood  Map-a translation of the circumplex model of emotion-and a series of  single-dimension mood scales. Using the prototype, participants could also activate  mobile therapies as needed. During weekly open-ended interviews, participants  discussed their use of the device and responded to longitudinal views of their data.  Analyses included a thematic review of interview narratives, assessment of mood  changes over the course of the study and the diurnal cycle, and interrogation of  this mobile data based on stressful incidents reported in interviews. RESULTS: Five  case studies illustrate participants' use of the mobile phone application to  increase self-awareness and to cope with stress. One example is a participant who  had been coping with longstanding marital conflict. After reflecting on his mood  data, particularly a drop in energy each evening, the participant began practicing  relaxation therapies on the phone before entering his house, applying cognitive  reappraisal techniques to cope with stressful family interactions, and talking more  openly with his wife. His mean anger, anxiety and sadness ratings all were lower in  the second half of the field study than in the first (P </= .01 for all three  scales). Similar changes were observed among other participants as they used the  application to negotiate bureaucratic frustrations, work tensions and personal  relationships. Participants appeared to understand the mood scales developed for  this experience sampling application and responded to them in a way that was  generally consistent with self-reflection in weekly interviews. Interview accounts  of mood changes, associated with diurnal cycles, personal improvement over the  course of the study, and stressful episodes, could be seen in the experience  sampling data. Discrepancies between interview and experience-sampling data  highlighted the ways that individuals responded to the two forms of inquiry and how  they calibrated mood ratings over the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Participants  quickly grasped the Mood Mapping and therapeutic concepts, and applied them  creatively in order to help themselves and empathize with others. Applications  developed for mobile phones hold promise for delivering state-of-the-art  psychotherapies in a nonstigmatizing fashion to many people who otherwise would not  have access to therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Alcohol use during adolescence is associated with the onset  of alcohol use disorders, mental health disorders, substance abuse as well as  socially and physically damaging behaviours, the effects of which last well into  adulthood. Nevertheless, alcohol use remains prevalent in this population.  Understanding motivations behind adolescent alcohol consumption may help in  developing more appropriate and effective interventions. This study aims to increase  this understanding by exploring the temporal relationship between mood and different  levels of alcohol intake in a sample of young people. DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-one  secondary school students used a purpose-designed mobile phone application to  monitor their daily mood and alcohol use for 20 random days within a 31 day period.  Generalised estimating equations were used to examine the relationship between  differing levels of alcohol consumption (light, intermediate and heavy) and positive  and negative mood three days before and after drinking episodes. RESULTS: While  there was no relationship between light and heavy drinking and positive mood, there  was an increase in positive mood before and after the drinking event for those that  drank intermediate amounts. No statistically significant relationships were found  between negative mood and any of the three drinking categories. DISCUSSION AND  CONCLUSION: Adolescents who drank in intermediate amounts on a single drinking  occasion experienced an increase in positive mood over the three days leading up to  and three days following a drinking event. These findings contribute to an  understanding of the motivations that underpin adolescent alcohol use, which may  help inform future interventions.

AB  - Randomized controlled trials conducted in resource-limited settings have shown that  once women with depressed mood are evaluated by specialists and referred for  treatment, lay health workers can be trained to effectively administer psychological  treatments. We sought to determine the extent to which community health workers  could also be trained to conduct case finding using short and ultrashort screening  instruments programmed into mobile phones. Pregnant, Xhosa-speaking women were  recruited independently in two cross-sectional studies (N = 1,144 and N = 361)  conducted in Khayelitsha, South Africa and assessed for antenatal depression. In the  smaller study, community health workers with no training in human subject research  were trained to administer the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during  the routine course of their community-based outreach. We compared the operating  characteristics of four short and ultrashort versions of the EPDS with the criterion  standard of probable depression, defined as an EPDS-10 ≥ 13. The prevalence of  probable depression (475/1144 [42 %] and 165/361 [46 %]) was consistent across both  samples. The 2-item subscale demonstrated poor internal consistency (Cronbach's α  ranged from 0.55 to 0.58). All four subscales demonstrated excellent discrimination,  with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values ranging  from 0.91 to 0.99. Maximal discrimination was observed for the 7-item depressive  symptoms subscale: at the conventional screening threshold of ≥10, it had 0.97  sensitivity and 0.76 specificity for detecting probable antenatal depression. The  comparability of the findings across the two studies suggests that it is feasible to  use community health workers to conduct case finding for antenatal depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of mobile phones has become one of the new research  topics in health professions education due to the ease of access and flexibility.  Although novel approaches to health professions education recommend the use of  educational technologies, such as mobile applications, a limited number of studies  have been conducted with regard to learning anatomy through mobile applications.  Considering the increasing needs of medical students for mobile technology to meet  their educational needs, wants and desires, we decided to explore the features of an  anatomy mobile application. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted in two  stages of holding focus groups, and an expert panel session. Students of basic  Medical sciences, and faculty members of anatomy at Iran University of Medical  Sciences formed the research participants. Semi-structured interviews and  note-taking were used to collect the data. Moreover, Brown and Clark methods were  used for thematic analysis. Finally, four criteria presented by Lincoln and Guba for  qualitative studies were used to ensure the credibility, confirmability,  trustworthiness and transferability of the data. RESULTS: Based on the data  analysis, 37 codes that could be used to design anatomy mobile content for medical  students were extracted. These features were categorized into eight main themes of  "visual richness", "scientific comprehensiveness", "auditory richness",  "affordability", "user-friendliness", "self-assessment", "interactive content" and  "user support". CONCLUSION: This study explored the features of an anatomy  application that can be used by educational app developers. Anatomy departments at  Medical Universities, policymakers, and curriculum planners in the field of medical  education can also adopt the findings of the present study.

AB  - AIM: Information sharing is a key component of family-centred care, which has  traditionally occurred through patient information leaflets. Although patients'  access to health information is rapidly changing with internet and mobile  technologies, there are few data on parents' perception and preferences for  information sharing. Our aim was to evaluate parents' perception of information  sharing in neonatal care, to determine parents' preferred medium for health  information and to identify priority content for inclusion in a smartphone  application. METHODS: Parents at Kidz First Neonatal Care (KFNC) were eligible to  take part in our survey, which comprised five sections: (i) demographics, (ii)  information in neonatal care, (iii) printed information in neonatal care, (iv)  parental views about development of a neonatal smartphone application and (v)  general feedback. Parental satisfaction with information sharing in KFNC was  assessed with a modified version of the Empowerment of Parents in the Intensive  Care-neonatology questionnaire. Descriptive and summary statistics were calculated,  and free text data were analysed by content analysis. RESULTS: Forty-one surveys  were received, with 62% completed by mothers. Parents were supportive of electronic  information, with 88% highly scoring the question 'I would download and use a free  neonatal care app'. However, parental views on the need to continue printed material  if a neonatal care smartphone application was provided were mixed. Of those parents  who provided free-text recommendations, priority content included information about  neonatal conditions, preparing for discharge and available supports. CONCLUSION:  Parents had positive perceptions of information sharing in neonatal care and were  strongly supportive of the introduction of a neonatal phone application.

AB  - Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide  and kills more Americans than 59 other infections, including HIV and tuberculosis,  combined. While direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments are effective, limited  uptake of therapy, particularly in high-risk groups, remains a substantial barrier  to eliminating HCV. We developed a long-acting DAA system (LA-DAAS) capable of  prolonged dosing and explored its cost-effectiveness. We designed a retrievable  coil-shaped LA-DAAS compatible with nasogastric tube administration and the capacity  to encapsulate and release gram levels of drugs while resident in the stomach. We  formulated DAAs in drug-polymer pills and studied the release kinetics for 1 mo in  vitro and in vivo in a swine model. The LA-DAAS was equipped with ethanol and  temperature sensors linked via Bluetooth to a phone application to provide patient  engagement. We then performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing LA-DAAS to DAA  alone in various patient groups, including people who inject drugs. Tunable release  kinetics of DAAs was enabled for 1 mo with drug-polymer pills in vitro, and the  LA-DAAS safely and successfully provided at least month-long release of sofosbuvir  in vivo. Temperature and alcohol sensors could interface with external sources for  at least 1 mo. The LA-DAAS was cost-effective compared to DAA therapy alone in all  groups considered (base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $39,800). We  believe that the LA-DAA system can provide a cost-effective and patient-centric  method for HCV treatment, including in high-risk populations who are currently  undertreated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholecystectomy is a common procedure with significantly varied  outcomes. We analyzed differences in comorbidities, outcomes, and cost of  cholecystectomy by acute care surgery (ACS) versus hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB)  surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Patients were retrospectively identified between 2008 and  2015. Exclusion criteria included the following: (1) part of another procedure; (2)  abdominal trauma; (3) ICU admission; vasopressors. RESULTS: One hundred and  twenty-six ACS and 122 HPB patients were analyzed. The HPB subset had higher burden  of comorbid disease and significantly lower projected 10-year survival (87.4% ACS vs  68.5% HPB, P < .0001). Median lengths of stay were longer in HPB patients (2 vs 5  days, P < .0001) as were readmission rates (30-day 5.6% vs 13.1%, P = .040; 90-day  7.9% vs 20.5%, P = .005). Median cost was higher including operative supply cost  ($969.42 vs $1920.66, P < .0001) and total cost of care ($7340.66 vs $19 338.05, P <  .0001). A predictive scoring system for difficult gallbladders was constructed and a  phone application was created. CONCLUSION: Cholecystectomy in a complicated patient  can be difficult with longer hospital stays and higher costs. The utilization of  procedure codes to explain disparities is not sufficient. Incorporation of  comorbidities needs to be addressed for planning and reimbursement.

AB  - Diabetes is a global epidemic that impacts millions of people every year. Enhanced  dietary assessment techniques are critical for maintaining a healthy life for a  diabetic patient. Moreover, hospitals must monitor their diabetic patients' food  intake to prescribe a certain amount of insulin. Malnutrition significantly  increases patient mortality, the duration of the hospital stay, and, ultimately,  medical costs. Currently, hospitals are not fully equipped to measure and track a  patient's nutritional intake, and the existing solutions require an extensive user  input, which introduces a lot of human errors causing endocrinologists to overlook  the measurement. This paper presents DietSensor, a wearable three-dimensional (3D)  measurement system, which uses an over the counter 3D camera to assist the hospital  personnel with measuring a patient's nutritional intake. The structured environment  of the hospital provides the opportunity to have access to the total nutritional  data of any meal prepared in the kitchen as a cloud database. DietSensor uses the 3D  scans and correlates them with the hospital kitchen database to calculate the exact  consumed nutrition by the patient. The system was tested on twelve volunteers with  no prior background or familiarity with the system. The overall calculated nutrition  from the DietSensor phone application was compared with the outputs from the 24-h  dietary recall (24HR) web application and MyFitnessPal phone application. The  average absolute error on the collected data was 73%, 51%, and 33% for the 24HR,  MyFitnessPal, and DietSensor systems, respectively.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A Measles rubella campaign that targeted 9 months to 14 year old  children was conducted in all the 47 counties in Kenya between 16th and 24th of May  2016. Micro-planning using an android phone-based app was undertaken to map out the  target population and logistics in all the counties 4 weeks to the campaign  implementation instead of 6 months as per the WHO recommendation. The outcomes of  the micro-planning exercise were a detailed micro-plan that served as a guide in  ensuring that every eligible individual in the population was vaccinated with potent  vaccine. A national Trainer of Trainers training was done to equip key officers with  new knowledge and skills in developing micro-plans at all levels. The micro planning  was done using a mobile phone app, the doforms that enabled data to be transmitted  real time to the national level. The objective of the study was to establish whether  use of mobile phone app would contribute to quality of sub national micro plans that  can be used for national level planning and implementation of the campaign. METHODS:  There were 9 data collection forms but only forms 1-7 were to be uploaded onto the  app. Forms 8A and 9A were to be filled but were to remain at the implementation  level for use intra campaign. The forms were coded; Form 1A&B, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A,  7A, 8A and 9A The Village form (form 1A&B) captured information by household which  included village names, name of head of household, cell phone contact of head of  household, number of children aged 9 months to 14years in the household, possible  barriers to reaching the children, appropriate vaccination strategy based on  barriers identified and estimated or proposed number of teams and type. This was the  main form and from this every other form picked the population figures to estimate  other supplies and logistics. On advocacy, communication and social mobilization the  information collected included mobile network coverage, public amenities such as  churches, mosques and key partners at the local level. On human resource and cold  chain supplies the information collected included number of health facilities by  type, number of health workers by cadre in facilities within the village, number of  vaccine carriers and icepacks by size, refrigerators and freezers. All these forms  were to be uploaded onto the phone app. except form 8A, the individual team plan,  which was to be used during implementation at the local level. Android phone  application, doforms, was used to capture data. Training on micro planning, data  entry and doforms app was conducted at National, County, Sub-county and ward levels  using standardized guidelines. An interactive case study was used in all the  trainings to facilitate understanding. The App was also available on Laptops through  its provided web-application. The app allowed multiple users to log in concurrently.  Feedback on all the variables were obtained from the team at the Ward level. The  ward level team included education officers or teachers, village elders, community  health workers and other community stakeholders. Only the Ward level was allowed to  collect information on paper and that information was subsequently transferred to  the phone-based app, doforms, by health information officers. The national, county  and sub county were able to access their data from the app using a password provided  by the administrator. RESULTS: Real time data was received from 46 of 47 counties.  One county (Marsabit) did not participate in the micro plan process. Over 97%  (283/290) of the sub counties responded and shared various information via the app.  Different data forms had different completion rates. There was 100% completion rate  for the data on villages and target population. Much valuable information was shared  but there was no time for the national and county level to interrogate and harmonize  for proper implementation. The information captured during the campaign can be used  for routine immunization and other community based interventions. Electronic data  collection not only provided the number of children but provided the locations also  where these children could be found. CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of time to  harmonize the micro plans with the national plan, the micro planning process was a  great success with 46/47 counties responding through the mobile phone app. Not only  did it provide the numbers of the target children, it further provided the places  where these children could be found. There was timely data transfer, data integrity,  tracking, real time data visualization reporting and analysis. The app enabled real  time feedback to national focal point by data entry clerks as well as enabling  trouble shooting by the administrator. This ensured campaign planning was done from  the lowest level to the national level.

T2  - JMIR research protocols
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a great necessity for new methods of evaluation of dietary  intake that overcome the limitations of traditional self-reporting methods.  OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a new method, based on an app  for mobile phones called e-EPIDEMIOLOGY, which was designed to collect individual  consumption data for a series of foods/drinks, and to compare this app with a  previously validated paper food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). METHODS: University  students >18 years of age recorded the consumption of certain foods/drinks using  e-EPIDEMIOLOGY during 28 consecutive days and then filled out a paper FFQ at the end  of the study period. To evaluate the agreement between the categories of habitual  consumption for each of the foods/drinks included in the study, cross-classification  analysis and a weighted kappa statistic were used. RESULTS: A total of 119  participants completed the study (71% female, 85/119; 29% male, 34/119).  Cross-classification analysis showed that 79.8% of the participants were correctly  classified into the same category and just 1.1% were misclassified into opposite  categories. The average weighted kappa statistic was good (κ=.64). CONCLUSIONS: The  results indicate that e-EPIDEMIOLOGY generated ranks of dietary intakes that were  highly comparable with the previously validated paper FFQ. However, it was noted  that further testing of e-EPIDEMIOLOGY is required to establish its wider utility.

AB  - A wearable depression monitoring system is proposed with an application-specific  system-on-chip (SoC) solution. The SoC is designed to accelerate the filtering and  feature extraction of heart-rate variability (HRV) from the electrocardiogram (ECG).  Thanks to the SoC solution and planar-fashionable circuit board (P-FCB), the  monitoring system becomes a low-power wearable system. Its dimension is 14cm × 7cm  with 5mm thickness covering the chest band for convenient usage. In addition, with  3.7V 500mAh battery, its lifetime is at least 10 hours. For user's convenience, the  system is interfacing to smart phones through Bluetooth communication. With the  features of the HRV and Beck depression inventory (BDI), the smart phone application  trains and classifies the user's depression scale with 71% of accuracy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Syphilis and gonorrhea reached an all-time high in 2018. The resurgence  of syphilis and gonorrhea requires innovative methods of sexual contact tracing that  encourage disclosure of same-sex sexual contacts that might otherwise be suppressed.  Over 75% of Grindr mobile phone application users report seeking "friendship," so  this study asked people diagnosed with syphilis and gonorrhea to identify their  friends. METHODS: Patients at the two Baltimore sexually transmitted infection (STI)  clinics and the Baltimore City Health Department were asked 12 questions to elicit  members of their friendship networks before eliciting sexual networks. The study  included 353 index cases and 172 friendship contacts, yielding a friendship network  of 331 non-isolates (n=331) and sexual-only network of 140 non-isolates. The data  were plotted and analyzed using exponential family random graph analysis. RESULTS:  Eliciting respondents' in-person social contacts yielded 12 syphilis cases and 6  gonorrhea cases in addition to the 16 syphilis cases and 4 gonorrhea cases that  would have been found with sexual contacts alone. Syphilis is clustered within  sexual (odds ratio=2.2, 95% confidence interval (1.36, 3.66)) and social contacts  (OR=1.31, 95% CI (1.02, 1.68)). Gonorrhea is clustered within reported social  (OR=1.56, 95% CI (1.22, 2.00)) but not sexual contacts (OR=0.98, 95% CI (0.62,  1.53)). CONCLUSIONS: Eliciting friendship networks of people diagnosed with syphilis  and gonorrhea may find members of their sexual networks, drug use networks, or  people of similar STI risk. Friendship networks include more diagnosed cases of  syphilis and gonorrhea than sexual networks alone, especially among populations with  many non-disclosing men who have sex with men (MSM) and women who have sex with  women (WSW). Future research should evaluate whether this friendship network method  of contact tracing can be implemented by adapting automated mobile phone COVID-19  contact tracing protocols, if these COVID-19 contact tracing methods are able to  maintain anonymity and public trust.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Validation of a non-invasive smart-phone based screening tool for  atherosclerosis and coronary arterial disease (CAD), which is the leading cause of  mortality worldwide. METHODS: We designed a three-channel photoplethysmography (PPG)  device that connects to a smart phone application for measuring pulse transit time  (PTT) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) using PPG probes that are simultaneously clipped  onto to the ear, index finger, and big toe, respectively. Validation was performed  through a clinical study with 100 participants (age 20 to 77) at a research hospital  in Nagpur, India. Study subjects were stratified by age and divided into three  groups corresponding to the disease severity: Coronary Arterial Disease ("CAD"),  hypertensive ("Pre-CAD"), and Healthy. MAIN RESULTS: PWV values derived from the  Ear-Toe measurements increased monotonically as a function of disease severity and  age, with median values of 14.2 m/s for the older-patient CAD group, 12.2 m/s for  the younger-patient CAD group, 11.6 m/s for the older-patient Pre-CAD group, 10.2  m/s for the younger-patient Pre-CAD group, 9.7 m/s for the older healthy controls,  and 8.4 m/s for the younger healthy controls. Using just two simple features, the  PTT and patient height, we demonstrate a machine learning prediction model for CAD  with a median accuracy of 0.83 (AUC). SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates the  ability to predict atherosclerosis and CAD using a simple low-cost multi-site PPG  tool that is powered by a mobile phone and does not require any electrocardiogram  (ECG) reference. Furthermore, this method only requires a single anthropometric  measurement, which is the patient's height.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of a mobile phone application for prehospital  notification on resuscitation and patient outcomes. DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective  cohort study with preintervention and postintervention cohorts. SETTING: Major  trauma centre in India. PARTICIPANTS: Injured patients being transported by  ambulance and allocated to red (highest) and yellow (medium) triage categories.  INTERVENTION: A prehospital notification application for use by ambulance and  emergency clinicians to notify emergency departments (EDs) of an impending arrival  of a patient requiring advanced lifesaving care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary  outcome was the proportion of eligible patients arriving at the hospital for which  prehospital notification occurred. Secondary outcomes were the availability of a  trauma cubicle, presence of a trauma team on patient arrival, time to first chest  X-ray, and ED and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Data from January 2017 to January  2018 were collected with 208 patients in the preintervention and 263 patients in the  postintervention period. The proportion of patients arriving after prehospital  notification improved from 0% to 11% (p<0.001). After the intervention, more  patients were managed with a trauma call-out (relative risk (RR) 1.30; 95% CI: 1.10  to 1.52); a trauma bay was ready for more patients (RR 1.47; 95% CI: 1.05 to 2.05)  and a trauma team leader present for more patients (RR 1.50; 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.10).  There was no difference in time to the initial chest X-ray (p=0.45). There was no  association with mortality at hospital discharge (RR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.23),  but the intervention was associated with significantly less risk of patients dying  in the ED (RR 0.11; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: The prehospital notification  application for severely injured patients had limited uptake but implementation was  associated with improved trauma reception and reduction in early deaths. Quality  improvement efforts with ongoing data collection using the trauma registry are  indicated to drive improvements in trauma outcomes in India. TRIAL REGISTRATION  NUMBER: NCT02877342.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with lower-limb trauma requiring immobilization have an  increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). While thromboprophylaxis for all  patients seems not effective, targeted thromboprophylaxis in high risk patients may  be an appropriate alternative. Therefore, we aimed to develop and validate a risk  assessment model for VTE risk: the TRiP(cast) score (Thrombosis Risk Prediction  following cast immobilization). METHODS: In this prediction model study, for  development, data were used from the MEGA study (case-control study into the  etiology of VTE) and for validation, data from the POT-CAST trial (randomized trial  on the effectiveness of thromboprophylaxis following cast immobilization) were used.  Model discrimination was calculated by estimating the Area Under the Curve (AUC).  For model calibration, observed and predicted risks were assessed. FINDINGS: The  TRiP(cast) score includes 14 items; one item for trauma severity (or type), one for  type of immobilization and 12 items related to patients' characteristics. Validation  analyses showed an AUC of 0.74 (95%CI 0.61-0.87) in the complete dataset (n = 1250)  and 0.72 (95%CI 0.60-0.84) in the imputed data set (n = 1435). The calibration plot  shows the degree of agreement between the observed and predicted risks (intercept  0.0016 and slope 0.933). Using a cut-off score of 7 points in the POT-CAST trial  (incidence 1.6%), the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive  values were 76.1%, 51.2%, 2.5%, and 99.2%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The  TRiP(cast) score provides a helpful tool in daily clinical practice to accurately  stratify patients in high versus low-risk categories in order to guide  thromboprophylaxis prescribing. To accommodate implementation in clinical practice a  mobile phone application has been developed. FUNDING: ZonMW VIMP grant:17110200011.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphone ownership is becoming ubiquitous among US adults, making the  delivery of health interventions via a mobile app (ie, mobile health [mHealth])  attractive to many researchers and clinicians. Meditation interventions have become  popular and have been delivered to study participants via mobile apps to improve a  range of health outcomes in both healthy adults and those with chronic diseases.  However, these meditation mHealth interventions have been limited by a lack of  high-quality control groups. More specifically, these studies have lacked  consistency in their use of active, time-matched, and attention-matched control  groups. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to beta test a novel health  education podcast control condition delivered via a smartphone app that would be a  strong comparator to be used in future studies of app-based meditation  interventions. METHODS: Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) cancer were  recruited nationally. Upon enrollment, participants were informed to download the  investigator-developed health education podcast app onto their mobile phone and  listen to ~60 min/week of cancer-related educational podcasts for 12 weeks. The  benchmarks for feasibility included ≥70% of participants completing ≥70% of the  prescribed 60 min/week of podcasts, ≥70% of participants reporting that they were  satisfied with the intervention, and ≥70% of participants reporting that they  enjoyed the health education podcasts. RESULTS: A total of 96 patients with MPN were  enrolled in the study; however, 19 never began the intervention. Of the 77 patients  who participated in the intervention, 39 completed the entire study (ie, sustained  participation through the follow-up period). Participation averaged 103.2 (SD 29.5)  min/week. For 83.3% (10/12) of the weeks, at least 70% of participants completed at  least 70% of their total prescribed use. Almost half of participants reported that  they enjoyed the health education podcasts (19/39, 48.7%) and were satisfied with  the intervention (17/39, 43.6%). There were no significant changes in cancer-related  outcomes from baseline to postintervention. CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week, health education  podcast mobile app was demanded but not accepted in a sample of patients with  cancer. Using the mobile app was not associated with significant changes in  cancer-related symptoms. Based on findings from this study, a health education  podcast mobile app may be a feasible option as a time- and attention-matched control  group for efficacy trials with more extensive formative research for the content of  the podcasts and its acceptability by the specific population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization's (WHO) Basic Emergency Care Course  (BEC) is a five day, in-person course covering basic assessment and life-saving  interventions. We developed two novel adjuncts for the WHO BEC: a suite of clinical  cases (BEC-Cases) to simulate patient care and a mobile phone application (BEC-App)  for reference. The purpose was to determine whether the use of these educational  adjuncts in a flipped classroom approach improves knowledge acquisition and  retention among healthcare workers in a low-resource setting. METHODS: We conducted  a prospective, cohort study from October 2017 through February 2018 at two district  hospitals in the Pwani Region of Tanzania. Descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact  t-tests, and Wilcoxon ranked-sum tests were used to examine whether the use of these  adjuncts resulted in improved learner knowledge. Participants were enrolled based on  location into two arms; Arm 1 received the BEC course and Arm 2 received the  BEC-Cases and BEC-App in addition to the BEC course. Both Arms were tested before  and after the BEC course, as well as a 7-month follow-up exam. All participants were  invited to focus groups on the course and adjuncts. RESULTS: A total of 24  participants were included, 12 (50%) of whom were followed to completion. Mean  pre-test scores in Arm 1 (50%) were similar to Arm 2 (53%) (p=0.52). Both arms had  improved test scores after the BEC Course Arm 1 (74%) and Arm 2 (87%), (p=0.03). At  7-month follow-up, though with significant participant loss to follow up, Arm 1 had  a mean follow-up exam score of 66%, and Arm 2, 74%. DISCUSSION: Implementation of  flipped classroom educational adjuncts for the WHO BEC course is feasible and may  improve healthcare worker learning in low resource settings. Our focus- group  feedback suggest that the course and adjuncts are user friendly and culturally  appropriate.

AB  - Water quality monitoring is important for identifying public health risks and  ensuring water safety. However, even when water sources are tested, many  institutions struggle to access data for immediate action or long-term  decision-making. We analyzed water testing structures among 26 regulated water  suppliers and public health surveillance agencies across six African countries and  identified four water quality data management typologies. Within each typology, we  then analyzed the potential for information and communication technology (ICT) tools  to facilitate water quality information flows. A consistent feature of all four  typologies was that testing activities occurred in laboratories or offices, not at  water sources; therefore, mobile phone-based data management may be most beneficial  for institutions that collect data from multiple remote laboratories. We implemented  a mobile phone application to facilitate water quality data collection within the  national public health agency in Senegal, Service National de l'Hygiène. Our results  indicate that using the phones to transmit more than just water quality data will  likely improve the effectiveness and sustainability of this type of intervention. We  conclude that an assessment of program structure, particularly its data flows,  provides a sound starting point for understanding the extent to which ICTs might  strengthen water quality monitoring efforts.

AB  - We created a paper test card that measures a common iodizing agent, iodate, in salt.  To test the analytical metrics, usability, and robustness of the paper test card  when it is used in low resource settings, the South African Medical Research Council  and GroundWork performed independent validation studies of the device. The accuracy  and precision metrics from both studies were comparable. In the SAMRC study, more  than 90% of the test results (n=1704) were correctly classified as corresponding to  adequately or inadequately iodized salt. The cards are suitable for market and  household surveys to determine whether salt is adequately iodized. Further  development of the cards will improve their utility for monitoring salt iodization  during production.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The ability to use electronic medical records (EMR) is an essential skill  for surgical residents. However, frustration and anxiety surrounding EMR tasks may  detract from clinical performance. We created a series of brief, 1-3 minutes "how  to" videos demonstrating 7 key perioperative EMR tasks: booking OR cases, placing  preprocedure orders, ordering negative-pressure wound dressing supplies, updating  day-of-surgery history and physical notes, writing brief operative notes,  discharging patients from the postanesthesia care unit, and checking vital signs.  Additionally, we used "Cutting Insights"-a locally developed responsive mobile  application for surgical trainee education-as a platform for providing interns with  easy access to these videos. We hypothesized that exposure to these videos would  lead to increased resident efficiency and confidence in performing essential  perioperative tasks, ultimately leading to improved clinical performance. METHODS:  Eleven surgery interns participated in this initiative. Before watching the "how to"  videos, each intern was timed performing the aforementioned 7 key perioperative EMR  tasks. They also underwent a simulated perioperative emergency requiring the  performance of 3 of these EMR tasks in conjunction with 5 other required  interventions (including notifying the chief resident, the anesthesia team, and the  OR coordinator; and ordering fluid boluses, appropriate laboratories, and blood  products). These simulations were scored on a scale from 0 to 8. The interns were  then directed to watch the videos. Two days later, their times for performing the 7  tasks and their scores for a similar perioperative emergency simulation were once  again recorded. Before and after watching the videos, participants were surveyed to  assess their confidence in performing each EMR task using a 5-point Likert scale. We  also elicited their opinions of the videos and web-based mobile application using a  5-point scale. Statistical analyses to assess for statistical significance (p ≤  0.05) were conducted using paired t-test for parametric variables and a Wilcoxon  matched-pair test for nonparametric variables. SETTING: Hospital of the University  of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA (a quaternary teaching hospital within the  University of Pennsylvania Health System). PARTICIPANTS: Eleven out of 15 interns  (12 entered and 11 completed the study) from our categorical and preliminary general  surgery residency programs during the 2016 academic year. RESULTS: Before exposure  to the brief "how to" videos, 6 of 11 interns were unable to complete all 7 EMR  tasks; after exposure, all 11 interns were able to complete all 7 EMR tasks.  Moreover, interns' times for each task improved following exposure. Interns  self-reported improved confidence in booking an OR case (4 ± 0.9 vs. 4.7 ± 0.6, p =  0.05), ordering negative-pressure wound therapy supplies (3.1 ± 1.6 vs. 4.5 ± 0.7, p  < 0.05), writing a brief operative note (3.7 ± 1.2 vs. 4.6 ± 0.7, p = 0.05),  discharging patients from the postanesthesia care unit (3.3 ± 1.0 vs. 4.4 ± 0.8, p <  0.05), checking vital signs (2.5 ± 1.4 vs. 4.5 ± 0.8, p ≤ 0.01), and performing  necessary EMR tasks during an emergency situation (2.4 ± 0.8 vs. 4.6 ± 0.7, p ≤  0.0001). Participants also demonstrated a significant improvement in average  clinical score on the emergency simulations (5.2 ± 1.7 vs. 6.6 ± 0.9, p < 0.05).  Interns' opinions of the videos and the mobile phone application were favorable.  CONCLUSIONS: In our group of 11 surgery interns, exposure to a series of short "how  to" videos led to increased confidence and shortened times in performing 7 essential  EMR tasks. Additionally, during a simulated perioperative emergency, EMR tasks were  performed significantly faster. Clinical performance also improved significantly  following exposure to the videos. This just-in-time educational intervention could  improve workflow efficiency and clinical performance, both of which may ultimately  enhance perioperative patient safety.

AB  - There are many useful medical treatment devices today, which are indispensable in  health care. However, in some emergency situations and in prehospital care mobile,  easy-to-use devices could further improve the patient-centred care. For example, a  mobile, easy-to-use home-monitoring EEG-system would be useful for monitoring  diseases like epilepsy and for treating diseases like attention deficit disorder  (ADHD) using biofeedback. Such a device should be equipped with the ability to start  self-performed by user recordings and provide high signal quality, while having an  affordable price. Here, we used in-ear-EEG technology and state of the art  electronic components to develop such a system. This paper presents a portable,  all-in-one EEG-system, capable to record biosignals on the external ear. An  amplifier was developed with ADS1299 and optimised to be coupled with a smartphone.  The system has a low price and at the same time provides high signal quality, has  very effective common-mode-rejection, performs a fast cold start and shows low power  consumptions which ensures a long time of operation. The system is easy to use and  could be self-mounted and controlled by unskilled users as well. Results of test  measurements are compared to a conventional EEG-System and show comparable records  results quality.

AB  - Rabies is a neglected zoonotic disease that causes an estimated 59,000 human deaths  worldwide annually, mostly in Africa and Asia. A target of zero human deaths from  dog-mediated rabies has been set for 2030, and large-scale control programs are now  advocated. However, in most low-income endemic countries surveillance to guide  rabies control is weak and few cases of rabies are recorded. There is an urgent need  to enhance surveillance to improve timely case detection and inform rabies control  and prevention, by operationalizing a "One Health" approach. Here we present data  from a study piloting Integrated Bite Case Management (IBCM) to support  intersectoral collaboration between health and veterinary workers in Tanzania. We  trained government staff to implement IBCM, comprising risk assessments of bite  patients by health workers, investigations by livestock field officers to diagnose  rabid animals, and use of a mobile phone application to support integration. IBCM  was introduced across 20 districts in four regions of Tanzania and results reported  after 1 year of implementation. Numbers of bite patient presentations to health  facilities varied across regions, but following the introduction of IBCM reporting  of bite patients at high-risk for rabies more than doubled in all regions. Over 800  high-risk investigations were carried out, with 49% assessed as probable dog rabies  cases on the basis of clinical signs, animal outcome, and rapid diagnostic testing.  The status of a further 20% of biting animals could not be determined but rabies  could not be ruled out. Livestock field officers reported that use of rapid  diagnostic tests (RDTs) were useful for confirming rabies occurrence. Overall, our  study provides further evidence that IBCM is a practical approach that can improve  rabies detection in endemic countries, and be used to monitor the impact of mass dog  vaccinations, including potential to verify rabies freedom. However, the main  challenges to implementation are limited training of health workers in rabies,  perceived burden of real-time recording and limited resources for livestock field  officers to undertake investigations. Nonetheless, IBCM dramatically improved case  detection and communication between sectors and we recommend further implementation  research to establish best practice and applicability to other settings.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the way CPR instructions are given has changed  because of the development of new technology that allows bystanders who witness a  cardiac arrest to be guided in performing CPR. This study aimed to compare the  effectiveness of using a mobile phone application (app) versus telephone operator  assistance in performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques in simulated  settings. METHODS: A comparative study was performed with 2 intervention groups: (1)  mobile phone app and (2) telephone assistance. A total of 128 students participated  and were distributed randomly into each intervention group. A CPR observation  checklist and standard CPR quality parameter measurements were used for data  collection. RESULTS: The group that used the app obtained better results than the  group that had telephone assistance on 5 items during CPR observation: checking if  the area is secure (X(2)(1) = 26.81; P < 0.05), asking for help (X(2)(1) = 66.07; P  < 0.05), opening of airways (X(2)(1) = 12.03; P < 0.05), checking for breathing  (X(2)(1) = 6.10; P < 0.05), and contacting emergency services (X(2)(1) = 12.41; P <  0.05). Regarding the skill level of CPR, no statistically significant differences  were found when comparing the 2 intervention groups (X(2)(1) = 0.91; P = 0.33). As  for the parameters measured, there were only statistically significant differences  found in the item compression fraction (U = 1,593.00; Z = -2.16; P < 0.05), with the  group that used the app obtaining better results. DISCUSSION: Better outcomes were  observed in recognizing if the area was safe, asking for help, opening up the  airways, checking for breathing, and calling emergency services in the mobile phone  app group. However, the results indicated that there were no differences in the CPR  parameters, except compression fraction, when the app was used as opposed to being  guided by telephone.

AB  - Fine particulate matter emissions (PM(2.5)) from landscape biomass fires, both  prescribed and wild, pose a significant public health risk, with smoke exposure  seasonally impacting human populations through both highly concentrated local  plumes, and more dispersed regional haze. A range of technologies now exist for  mapping and modeling atmospheric particulate concentration, including low-cost  mobile monitors, dispersion and chemical transport modeling, multi-spectral earth  observation satellites, weather radar, as well as publicly available real-time data  feeds from agencies providing information about fire activity on the ground.  Ubiquitous smart phone availability also allows instant public reporting of both  health symptoms and smoke exposure. We describe a web-based visual display  interface, Air Quality Visualization (AQVx), developed to allow the overlaying,  synchronization and comparison of a range of maps and data layers, in order to both  assess the potential public health impact of landscape fire smoke plumes, and the  accuracy of dispersion models. The system was trialed in the state of Victoria, in  south-eastern Australia, within the domain of the AQFx chemical transport model,  where large-scale annual prescribed burning operations (~11,000 km(2) yr) are  carried out, and where extreme wildfires frequently occur during the summer months.  AQVx, coupled with the ARSmoke smart phone application, allowed managers to rapidly  validate modeled smoke transport against satellite imagery, and identify potential  exposure risks to populated areas.

AB  - We implemented a mobile phone application of the pentagon drawing test (PDT), called  mPDT, with a novel, automatic, and qualitative scoring method for the application  based on U-Net (a convolutional network for biomedical image segmentation) coupled  with mobile sensor data obtained with the mPDT. For the scoring protocol, the U-Net  was trained with 199 PDT hand-drawn images of 512ⅹ512 resolution obtained via the  mPDT in order to generate a trained model, Deep5, for segmenting a drawn right or  left pentagon. The U-Net was also trained with 199 images of 512ⅹ512 resolution to  attain the trained model, DeepLock, for segmenting an interlocking figure. Here, the  epochs were iterated until the accuracy was greater than 98% and saturated. The  mobile senor data primarily consisted of x and y coordinates, timestamps, and  touch-events of all the samples with a 20 ms sampling period. The velocities were  then calculated using the primary sensor data. With Deep5, DeepLock, and the sensor  data, four parameters were extracted. These included the number of angles (0-4  points), distance/intersection between the two drawn figures (0-4 points),  closure/opening of the drawn figure contours (0-2 points), and tremors detected (0-1  points). The parameters gave a scaling of 11 points in total. The performance  evaluation for the mPDT included 230 images from subjects and their associated  sensor data. The results of the performance test indicated, respectively, a  sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision of 97.53%, 92.62%, 94.35%, and  87.78% for the number of angles parameter; 93.10%, 97.90%, 96.09%, and 96.43% for  the distance/intersection parameter; 94.03%, 90.63%, 92.61%, and 93.33% for the  closure/opening parameter; and 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, and 100.00% for the  detected tremor parameter. These results suggest that the mPDT is very robust in  differentiating dementia disease subtypes and is able to contribute to clinical  practice and field studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PTSS) are common after  minor injuries and can impair recovery. We sought to understand whether an  evidence-based mobile phone application with self-help tools (PTSD Coach) could be  useful to improve recovery after acute trauma among injured emergency department  (ED) patients. This pilot study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and  potential benefit of using PTSD Coach among acutely injured motor vehicle crash  (MVC) patients. METHODS: From September 2017 to September 2018, we recruited adult  patients within 24 hours post-MVC from the EDs of two Level I trauma centers in the  United States. We randomly assigned 64 injured adults to either the PTSD Coach  (n = 33) or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 31) condition. We assessed PTSS and  associated symptoms at 1 month (83% retained) and 3 months (73% retained)  postenrollment. RESULTS: Enrollment was feasible (74% of eligible subjects  participated) but usability and engagement were low (67% used PTSD Coach at least  once, primarily in week 1); 76% of those who used it rated the app as moderately to  extremely helpful. No differences emerged between groups in PTSS outcomes.  Exploratory analyses among black subjects (n = 21) indicated that those in the PTSD  Coach condition (vs. TAU) reported marginally lower PTSS (95% CI = -0.30 to 37.77)  and higher PTSS coping self-efficacy (95% CI = -58.20 to -3.61) at 3 months.  CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated feasibility to recruit acutely injured ED patients into  an app-based intervention study, yet mixed evidence emerged for the usability and  benefit of PTSD Coach. Most patients used the app once and rated it favorably in  regard to satisfaction with and helpfulness, but longitudinal engagement was low.  This latter finding may explain the lack of overall effects on PTSS. Additional  research is warranted regarding whether targeting more symptomatic patients and the  addition of engagement and support features can improve efficacy.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of  a multi-component mobile contingency management (CM) pilot intervention for smoking  cessation for people with schizophrenia. Methods: This intervention included mobile  CM (i.e., monetary compensation for bioverification of abstinence through using a  phone app), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and pharmacotherapy for smoking  cessation. This intervention was compared to an intensive treatment comparison  (ITC), which contained all components except the CM. Participants were bioverified  with carbon monoxide and saliva cotinine at a 6-month follow-up session. Results: In  this pilot, the treatment group did not differ from the ITC at any time point.  However, measures of treatment feasibility and acceptability indicated that smokers  with schizophrenia were able to navigate the CM phone application and adhere to the  protocol, demonstrating the potential utility of mobile interventions in this  population. Conclusions: Despite lack of long-term abstinence for participants,  adherence to the mobile application intervention indicates the potential for future  investigation of mobile smoking cessation treatments for people with schizophrenia.

AB  - Parrots are often referenced in discussions of social and cognitive complexity, yet  relatively little is known of their social organization in the wild. In particular,  the presence of long-lasting social ties has been highlighted as a hallmark of  social complexity; however, the presence of such ties can be masked in  fission-fusion systems like that exhibited by most parrot species. Social network  analysis has the potential to elucidate such multi-level dynamics. While most parrot  species are tropical canopy dwellers, a subset has successfully colonized urban  habitats, where they are often the focus of much public interest. Our study takes  advantage of this to use citizen science to collect observations of wing-tagged  sulphur-crested cockatoos in central Sydney and record their social associations  over multiple years. Using a specifically designed mobile phone application  'Wingtags', we collected over >27,000 citizen science reports of wing-tagged  cockatoos, and built social networks from spatial-temporal co-occurrences in  observations for 130 tagged birds. To validate this novel methodology, we GPS-tagged  a subset of wing-tagged birds and compared networks built from both data collection  methods. We then examined correlates of social network structure before exploring  the temporal dynamics of network structure and social associations. Social networks  constructed from GPS data and citizen science data were highly correlated,  suggesting that this novel methodology is robust. Network structure exhibited little  seasonal variability and was largely driven by roost site choice; however,  individuals also showed a surprising degree of mixing between roosts in their  foraging associations. Finally, within this larger fission-fusion system,  individuals tended to maintain specific social ties for long periods of time. There  was an effect of age on these temporal dynamics, with aging individuals increasing  both social stability and longevity of associations. Our findings highlight the  utility of citizen science to measure social networks in urban species, and add to  the evidence that long-lasting social associations can persist in fission-fusion  social systems such as those observed in wild sulphur-crested cockatoos.

AB  - Glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness, affects >70 million people  worldwide. Lowering intraocular pressure via topical administration of eye drops is  the most common first-line therapy for glaucoma. This treatment paradigm has  notoriously high non-adherence rates: ranging from 30% to 80%. The advent of smart  phone enabled technologies creates promise for improving eyedrop adherence. However,  previous eyedrop electronic monitoring solutions had awkward medication bottle  adjuncts and crude software for monitoring the administration of a drop that  adversely affected their ability to foster sustainable improvements in adherence.  The current work begins to address this unmet need for wireless technology by  creating a "smart drop" bottle. This medication bottle is instrumented with sensing  electronics that enable detection of each eyedrop administered while maintaining the  shape and size of the bottle. This is achieved by a thin electronic force sensor  wrapped around the bottle and underneath the label, interfaced with a thin  electronic circuit underneath the bottle that allows for detection and wireless  transmission to a smart-phone application. We demonstrate 100% success rate of  wireless communication over 75 feet with <1% false positive and false negative rates  of single drop deliveries, thus providing a viable solution for eyedrop monitoring  for glaucoma patients.

AB  - We gathered a data set from 30 patients with type 1 diabetes by giving the patients  a mobile phone application, where they recorded blood glucose measurements, insulin  injections, meals, and physical activity. Using these data as a learning data set,  we describe a new approach of building a mobile feedback system for these patients  based on periodicities, pattern recognition, and scale-space trends. Most patients  have important patterns for periodicities and trends, though better resolution of  input variables is needed to provide useful feedback using pattern recognition.

To meet volume constraints, we  designed a miniaturized compact illuminating and imaging optical component. The  objective was to minimize optical loss using several nano- and micro-fabrication  methods. After integration into a single optical body, the prototype imager-with  dimensions of 6.8 × 2.2 × 2.5 mm and a weight of 0.4 g-demonstrated clear  feasibility in measuring 2D micropatterns with widths of 50 and 10 μm.

AB  - PURPOSE: In this study, we investigate to what degree augmented reality technology  can be used to create and evaluate a visual-to-auditory sensory substitution device  to improve the performance of blind persons in navigation and recognition tasks.  METHODS: A sensory substitution algorithm that translates 3D visual information into  audio feedback was designed. This algorithm was integrated in an augmented reality  based mobile phone application. Using the mobile device as sensory substitution  device, a study with blind participants (n = 7) was performed. The participants  navigated through pseudo-randomized obstacle courses using either the sensory  substitution device, a white cane or a combination of both. In a second task,  virtual 3D objects and structures had to be identified by the participants using the  same sensory substitution device. RESULTS: The realized application for mobile  devices enabled participants to complete the navigation and object recognition tasks  in an experimental environment already within the first trials without previous  training. This demonstrates the general feasibility and low entry barrier of the  designed sensory substitution algorithm. In direct comparison to the white cane,  within the study duration of ten hours the sensory substitution device did not offer  a statistically significant improvement in navigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anticipated HIV stigma, i.e., the expectation of adverse experiences  from one's seroconversion, is associated with both negative psychological and  behavioral outcomes. We know little about anticipated HIV stigma's relationship with  emerging technologies, such as HIV self-testing (HIVST) and online sex-seeking  platforms, that have become popular among populations that are disproportionately  affected by HIV/AIDS. This study examined correlates of anticipated HIV stigma among  Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: In July 2016, MSM, who  were ≥ 16 years old and self-reported as HIV negative or unknown, were recruited  from a gay mobile phone application in China. Information regarding  socio-demographics, sexual behaviors, sexual health service utilization, and  anticipated HIV stigma were collected. Anticipated HIV stigma (i.e., negative  attitude toward future stigmatization of HIV seroconversion by others) was measured  as the mean score from a 7-item Likert-scale ranging from 1 (low) to 4 (high).  Generalized linear models were conducted to examine the factors associated with the  anticipated HIV stigma scores. RESULTS: Overall, 2006 men completed the survey. Most  men completed high school (1308/2006, 65.2%) and had an annual personal income of  ≤9200 USD (1431/2006, 71.3%). The mean anticipated HIV stigma score for the  participants was 2.98 ± 0.64. Using social media to seek sexual partners was  associated with higher anticipated HIV stigma (Adjusted β = 0.11, 95% confidence  interval (CI): 0.05 to 0.17, p = 0.001). HIV self-testing (Adjusted β = - 0.07,  95%CI: - 0.13 to - 0.01, p = 0.02) and having disclosed one's sexual orientation to  a healthcare provider (Adjusted β = - 0.16, 95%CI: - 0.22 to - 0.96, p < 0.001) were  associated with lower anticipated HIV stigma. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that  anticipated HIV stigma is still common among Chinese MSM not living with HIV.  Tailored anti-HIV stigma campaigns on social media are especially needed, and the  promotion of HIVST may be a promising approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent trauma guidelines recommend non-operative management for grade  III splenic injury without contrast extravasation on computed tomography.  Nevertheless, such recommendations rely on low-quality evidence, and practice  variation characterizes clinical management for this type of injury. We aimed to  identify the role of eleven selected clinical factors influencing the management of  grade III splenic injury without contrast extravasation by expert consensus and a  modified Delphi approach. METHODS: A questionnaire was developed with the  endorsement of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES). This was delivered and  answered live by acute care surgeons attending the 6(th) WSES congress in Nijmegen  in 2019. A dedicated mobile phone application was utilized to collect the answers.  All answers were evaluated for areas of discrepancy with an 80% threshold for  consensus between respondents. RESULTS: Three factors generated discrepancy in  opinion for managing this pattern of injury: the patients' injury severity, the  presence of a bleeding diathesis, and an associated intra-abdominal injury.  Agreement was obtained for the other eight factors. CONCLUSION: Researchers should  focus their efforts on the identified area of discrepancy. Clinicians should use  additional care in the presence of the three factors for which discordant opinions  were found.
